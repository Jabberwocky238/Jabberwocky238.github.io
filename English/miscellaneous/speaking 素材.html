<p>XXX can help ==cultivate critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and communication skills==, which are valuable in any discipline.</p>
<p>XXX can ==foster an appreciation for diverse perspectives and enhance empathy==, qualities that are crucial in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>XXX can ==provide AAA with a broader context for their work==, allowing them to better consider ==societal implications== of their research.

<p>While not directly related to their technical expertise, ==BBB gained in XXX can make AAA more well-rounded, adaptable, and effective in their future professions.==</p>
<p>Teaching AAA alongside BBB ==provides students with a broader perspective and a more comprehensive understanding of global events and cultures.==</p>
<p>This not only ==fosters empathy and tolerance towards different cultures== but also helps students see their own country’s history in a wider context, understanding its global influences and interconnections.</p>
<p>In an increasingly globalized world, XXX is crucial for understanding contemporary international relations and global issues.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that history education should be balanced and inclusive, not favoring one narrative over another, to promote critical thinking and analytical skills.</p>
<p>I believe that privacy is a fundamental right and should be respected, even in parent-child relationships。</p>
<p>Reading a child’s emails or text messages without their permission can undermine trust and potentially infringe on their developing sense of independence.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t negate a parent’s responsibility to ensure their child’s safety.</p>
<p>Conversation and open communication about ==digital etiquette==, online dangers, and setting appropriate boundaries can be more effective approaches.
=netiquette</p>
<p>In certain circumstances where there are serious concerns about a child’s safety or well-being, it may be justified for parents to monitor their communications, but this should ideally be done transparently and with the child’s knowledge.</p>
<p>Striking a balance between AAA and BBB is crucial.
Striking a balance between respecting privacy and ensuring safety is crucial.</p>
<p>learning from books in a formal educational setting is also valuable</p>
<p>My choice would depend on my learning style and what I hope to gain from the course. If I thrive in a more interactive setting where I can learn from peers, the second course may be more appealing.</p>
<p>Class discussions can promote critical thinking, engagement, and a deep understanding of topics.</p>
<p>They also provide opportunities to practice communication skills and to learn from diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>However, if I prefer a structured learning environment where I can absorb information from an expert, the first course may be more suitable.</p>
<p>A good lecturer can provide clear explanations, convey complex ideas effectively, and create a compelling narrative that makes the material more engaging and memorable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, both approaches have their merits and can offer valuable learning experiences.</p>
<p>I would lean toward the preference of staying in touch with friends and family while traveling.</p>
<p>This approach allows for sharing unique experiences and insights in real-time, fostering a sense of shared joy and discovery even when apart.</p>
<p>It also provides a safety net, as loved ones can offer assistance or advice in case of unexpected situations or emergencies.</p>
<p>Moreover, in today’s digital era, maintaining contact doesn’t necessarily ==intrude== on the travel experience but can rather enrich it.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to strike a balance, ensuring that the act of staying connected doesn’t overshadow the immersive experience of exploring new places and cultures.</p>
<p>I agree with the statement that restaurants should provide nutritional information about their food items.</p>
<p>Providing such information empowers customers to make ==informed== decisions about their food choices, catering to those with specific dietary needs or goals, and ==promoting overall health consciousness.==</p>
<p>This transparency can help individuals manage dietary restrictions, allergies, or conditions like diabetes or heart disease.</p>
<p>In a society facing increasing health concerns related to diet, such as obesity and related diseases, having access to nutritional information can aid in fostering healthier eating habits.</p>
<p>It’s essential that this information is ==presented in a clear, comprehensible manner==, so customers can easily understand and utilize it.</p>
<p>This practice also aligns restaurants with a trend toward more transparency in many aspects of consumer goods and services.</p>

It is the policy of many universities that parents of university students cannot have access to their child&#x27;s grades without their children&#x27;s permission. Do you agree or disagree with this policy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the policy that parents of university students cannot access their child’s grades without their permission.</p>
<p>This policy ==aligns with== the rights to privacy and autonomy of adult students. University is a time for students to develop independence, and managing their academic performance is an essential part of this growth.</p>
<p>It encourages students to ==take responsibility for their actions and learning outcomes.==</p>
<p>Furthermore, it promotes open communication, as students are more likely to discuss academic challenges with their parents if they feel their privacy is respected.</p>
<p>While parents understandably ==have a vested interest in== their child’s academic success, it’s important to foster an environment of trust and personal responsibility as students transition into adulthood.</p>

Your university is planning to invite some guest speakers to give lectures to students. Some students think that the university should not invite guest speakers with controversial opinions. Other students think that the university should invite variety of guests speakers, regardless of their opinions. Which point of view do you support? Explain why</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would support the standpoint of inviting a variety of guest speakers, regardless of the perceived controversy of their opinions. Universities serve as platforms for intellectual diversity and free thought, and this is often best served by exposing students to a wide array of perspectives. Encountering differing or controversial viewpoints can stimulate critical thinking, encourage robust debate, and promote a deeper understanding of complex issues.</p>
<p>However, it’s vital that these discussions are moderated in a way that fosters respect and understanding, rather than animosity or division. It’s also crucial that the expression of controversial opinions doesn’t infringe on the rights or safety of others, and maintains the inclusive, respectful environment that a university should uphold.</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Nowadays, for a business to be successful, it must be actively involved in social media</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that in today’s digital age, a business’s active involvement in social media can significantly contribute to its success. Social media platforms allow businesses to reach a wider audience, engage directly with customers, and gather valuable feedback. They also offer opportunities for cost-effective marketing, brand development, and customer service improvements. Moreover, social media enables businesses to monitor trends, track competitors, and respond promptly to industry changes. However, success isn’t solely determined by social media presence; traditional business principles like product quality, customer service, and sound financial management remain crucial. Additionally, a poorly managed social media presence can harm a business’s reputation. Therefore, while social media is a powerful tool for businesses, it should be used strategically and complemented with other business practices.</p>

<p>Some universities expect students to choose a major field of study when they enter university. Other universities allow students to wait until the second or third year before deciding on a major field of study. Which do you think is better? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both approaches have their merits, but allowing students to wait until their second or third year to decide on a major can offer several benefits. This flexibility provides students time to explore different disciplines, helping them make a more informed decision about their major. They can identify their strengths, interests, and career aspirations more clearly, leading to a more fulfilling academic experience and potentially better career alignment. Early university years can be transformative, and the freedom to explore can contribute significantly to personal and intellectual growth. However, guidance and resources should be available to help students make informed decisions within this period, ensuring they can meet their chosen major’s requirements without delaying graduation.</p>

Other students think that the university should invite variety of guests speakers, regardless of their opinions. Which point of view do you support? Explain why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would support the position of inviting a variety of guest speakers, including those with controversial opinions. Universities should serve as a platform for open dialogue and intellectual diversity, and this includes exposure to a wide range of viewpoints. Encountering diverse or even controversial opinions can stimulate critical thinking, encourage meaningful discussion, and foster a deeper understanding of complex issues. However, it’s crucial that this dialogue is conducted in a respectful and productive manner. Controversial speakers should not promote hate speech or intolerance, and a balance of viewpoints should be represented to avoid endorsing a single, potentially divisive perspective. So, while diversity of thought should be encouraged, it must be managed carefully to ensure a respectful and inclusive academic environment.</p>

<p>Nowadays, some people use extreme methods, including surgery, to change their appearance-usually because they are trying to look more attractive in some way. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why you agree or disagree with people using such methods to change how they look. Support your opinion with details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a high school student, I believe that using extreme methods, such as surgery, to alter one’s appearance is a personal decision, but it’s not one that I would advocate for, especially at my age. We’re still growing and changing, and our perceptions of ourselves are likely to evolve as well.</p>
<p>Firstly, surgeries come with inherent risks and potential complications, which could lead to long-term health issues. Secondly, the desire for such extreme changes often stems from societal pressure and unrealistic beauty standards. We should focus on promoting self-acceptance and body positivity, rather than conforming to such pressures.</p>
<p>Instead of resorting to extreme methods, it’s healthier to develop self-confidence and a positive body image through natural means, such as maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and fostering a positive mindset about ourselves. It’s crucial to remember that real beauty comes from within and that everyone is unique in their own way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people prefer to have friends who share the same opinions or beliefs about the world as they do. Other people prefer to have friends who have opinions or beliefs about the world that are different from their own. Which do you think is best? Explain why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe having friends with differing opinions can be enlightening and beneficial. At this stage in life, we’re learning about ourselves and the world around us, and friends who challenge our beliefs can help broaden our horizons can introduce us to new ideas, cultures, and perspectives we might not otherwise encounter, fostering a more comprehensive worldview and promoting personal growth.</p>
<p>Having said that, friends who share similar beliefs and opinions can provide a sense of comfort, understanding, and validation, which is also important. They can offer support and camaraderie in our shared experiences.</p>
<p>So, I think a balance of both is ideal. This way, we can enjoy the support and validation of like-minded friends while also welcoming the growth that comes from understanding varying perspectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.14 线下 Some people like to seek advice from their parents or grandparents when they encounter a difficult situation, while others prefer to get advice from their peers. Which do you prefer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to lean towards 我倾向于</p>
<p>I tend to lean towards seeking advice from my peers when encountering difficult situation.</p>
<p>This is because our shared experiences and similar age often mean they can better understand the challenges I face, especially those related to school, social situations, or technology.</p>
<p>They usually provide advice that’s more relevant to our contemporary context and relatable to my day-to-day life.</p>
<p>However, I also appreciate the wisdom and experience that parents or grandparents can offer.</p>
<p>They provide a broader perspective, drawing from their own life experiences which can be particularly helpful for more serious or long-term decisions.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe using a mix of both channels for advice can yield well-rounded guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.17 家考 Imagine that you have been offered two new jobs. The first job pays a very high salary but requires you to travel a long distance to work each day. The second job does not pay as much, but you would not have to travel very far to work. Would you prefer to first job or the second job. Explain why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to prioritize work-life balance and time efficiency, I would lean towards the second job. While the salary is lower, the reduced commute would save time and stress, contributing to a better quality of life. This time could be used for personal growth, hobbies, or spending with loved ones, which can be invaluable. Less travel also means fewer transportation costs, which could partly offset the lower salary. However, it’s also essential to consider other factors like the nature of the work, career growth opportunities, and personal financial situation. Each individual’s choice would depend on their priorities, lifestyle, and long-term career goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.18 线下 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People from an ordinary, simple background will become better government leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The background of a leader does not necessarily determine their effectiveness in government. While someone from an ordinary, simple background may have a better understanding of the general population’s needs and can bring valuable perspectives to governance, leadership effectiveness also relies on qualities like integrity, intelligence, empathy, and the ability to make sound decisions. Leaders from diverse backgrounds, whether simple or privileged, can be effective if they demonstrate these qualities. What matters most is their commitment to serve the public, their understanding of complex policy issues, and their ability to communicate and work well with others. Therefore, it’s important not to generalize about leadership capabilities based on background alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.21 线下（上午场） To let students focus more time on study, your school is going to limit the number of the clubs and organizations that every student can attend. Do you think this is a good idea?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the intent to help students focus more on their studies is understandable, limiting the number of clubs and organizations a student can attend might not be the optimal approach. Participating in clubs and organizations is crucial for holistic development. They provide opportunities for students to pursue their interests, develop social and leadership skills, and apply what they learn in a practical context. These experiences often complement academic learning and can be as valuable as classroom study in shaping a well-rounded individual. Instead of limiting participation, schools could help students manage their time more effectively, providing guidance on balancing academic commitments with extracurricular activities. This approach encourages students to make informed decisions about their activities, fostering responsibility and time-management skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.21 线下（下午场） Some people believe that setting goals for themselves is important in order to be successful in life. Others believe that success can be achieved without setting goals. Which point of view do you agree with? Explain why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would lean towards the view that setting goals is important for success. Goals provide a roadmap, helping to focus efforts, maintain motivation, and measure progress. They enable individuals to prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and make strategic decisions aligned with their objectives. Goals can also boost confidence and motivation as individuals achieve them step by step, making even ambitious dreams seem achievable. Furthermore, goals facilitate self-discipline, fostering habits that can lead to success not only in the targeted areas but also in life in general. While flexibility and adaptability are also crucial, they can be incorporated into goal-setting through regular reassessment and adjustment of goals. Thus, structured goal-setting, combined with an adaptable mindset, can be a potent formula for success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.22 线下 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should be encouraged to watch or listen to the news from an early age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the statement that children should be encouraged to engage with the news from an early age. This can foster awareness of the world around them, promote critical thinking skills, and stimulate interest in current affairs. It can also help children develop media literacy, which is increasingly important in our digital age. However, it’s essential that this engagement is age-appropriate and guided. Some news content can be distressing or complex for children, so adult supervision or curated news resources designed for children can ensure a positive and constructive experience. Discussing the news with children can also help them understand complex issues and navigate any concerns or misunderstandings they may have, encouraging an informed and empathetic worldview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.28 线下 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should be self-sufficient instead of depending on others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>虽然自给自足是一种宝贵的特质，但我不同意人们应该完全依赖它而不依赖他人的说法。</p>
<p>人类本质上是社会性的，在历史上，合作和相互支持对我们的生存和进步至关重要。</p>
<p>在需要的时候依赖他人并不意味着软弱；</p>
<p>相反，它促进了社区、协作和同理心。</p>
<p>同时，在任务和责任上自给自足对个人成长和独立至关重要。</p>
<p>这是关于找到一种平衡——能够自立，但也愿意在必要时寻求帮助。</p>
<p>这种方法既能培养个人的复原力，又能培养强大的支持性社区，这两者对健康的社会都很重要。</p>
<p>While self-sufficiency is a valuable trait, I would disagree with the assertion that people should solely rely on it without depending on others at all. Humans are inherently social beings, and cooperation and mutual support have been crucial to our survival and progress throughout history. Depending on others in times of need doesn’t signify weakness; instead, it promotes community, collaboration, and empathy. Simultaneously, being self-sufficient in one’s tasks and responsibilities is essential to personal growth and independence. It’s about finding a balance - being able to stand on one’s own feet, but also being willing to ask for and offer help when necessary. This approach fosters both individual resilience and strong, supportive communities, both of which are important for a healthy society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023.10.29 线下 Your university currently requires all students to take one humanities course in a subject such as literature or philosophy in order to graduate. However, some students majoring in subjects such as math and science think that these humanities courses are not relevant to their field of study, and they should therefore not be required to take them, Do you agree with these students? Explain why or why not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>==虽然学生们可能更喜欢只关注自己的专业是可以理解的，但我不同意人文学科课程与数学和科学专业无关的观点。==</p>
<p>==人文课程可以帮助培养批判性思维、道德推理和有效沟通等基本技能，这些技能在任何专业领域都很有价值。==</p>
<p>==它们还可以培养对不同观点的欣赏，增强同理心，这些品质在日益互联的世界中至关重要。==</p>
<p>==此外，了解人类文化和历史可以为科学家和数学家的工作提供更广泛的背景，使他们能够考虑其研究和创新的社会影响。==</p>
<p>==虽然这些课程可能看起来毫无关联，但所获得的知识和技能可以使学生在未来的职业生涯中更加全面、适应能力强和有效。==</p>
<p>While it’s understandable that students may prefer to focus solely on their major, I disagree with the notion that humanities courses are irrelevant for math and science majors.</p>
<p>Humanities courses can help cultivate essential skills like critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and effective communication, which are valuable in any professional field.</p>
<p>They can also foster an appreciation for diverse perspectives and enhance empathy, qualities that are crucial in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Moreover, understanding human culture and history can offer scientists and mathematicians a broader context for their work, allowing them to consider the societal implications of their research and innovations.</p>
<p>While these courses may seem unrelated, the knowledge and skills gained can make students more well-rounded, adaptable, and effective in their future careers.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/English/miscellaneous/speaking 3"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">上一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">speaking 3</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/English/miscellaneous/speaking1"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">下一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">speaking1</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/intro">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 JW238, Inc.
