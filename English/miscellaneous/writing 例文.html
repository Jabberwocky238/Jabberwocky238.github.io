their impact pales in comparison to what can be achieved through institutional efforts==.</p>
<p>Individuals can adopt more sustainable habits, like reducing plastic consumption, proper disposal of hazardous waste, and participating in local clean-up events.</p>
<p>These actions ==foster a culture of environmental responsibility== and can indirectly influence broader community practices.</p>
<p>However, the scope of pollution and its effects are ==so vast that== they require robust, systemic interventions that only larger entities like governments and corporations can effectively implement.</p>
<p>These institutions can ==enact stringent regulations==, ==develop infrastructure for better waste management==, ==and invest in advanced technologies== for water treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, corporations have the ability to redesign products and packaging to be less polluting and more sustainable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while individual contributions are crucial for ==raising awareness and prompting change==, the scale of impact needed to significantly reduce water pollution necessitates aggressive and coordinated efforts by larger institutions.</p>
<p>Both approaches are essential, but the latter offers the structural power to enact lasting changes.</p>

<p>它消除了携带现金的需要，因为携带现金既麻烦又有风险。</p>
<p>电子商务的兴起加速了这一转变，使数字支付成为许多消费者的首选。</p>
<p>此外，数字支付记录提供了更大的fina
国家透明度和安全性。审计跟踪使跟踪支出和防止欺诈更加容易。这可能有利于家庭预算，尽管Claire关于数字支付可能超支的观点是有效的。</p>
<p>消费者需要调整他们的财务习惯，但增加便利性、安全性和透明度的好处似乎超过了挑战。虽然有一些缺点，但在我看来，向一个不那么依赖现金的社会过渡是一个积极的趋势，与我们世界日益数字化的趋势相一致。</p>

<p>我是那种喜欢看电视的人。</p>
<p>第一个原因是看电视能让我放松。</p>
<p>当我休息的时候，我不喜欢做任何事情，只是坐在沙发上看一个好的电视节目。</p>
<p>看电视完全不费力气，而且它是同时也是摆脱压力的有效方法。</p>
<p>另一个原因是，我其实从看电视中可以学到很多东西。</p>
<p>简单地说，我看很多教育节目 甚至有时也看新闻。</p>
<p>如今，有这么多的频道和节目是专门为学习而设的。</p>
<p>由于我通过视觉方法比通过文字方法学习效果更好，所以我尽可能多地看电视。</p>

<p>计算机可以在互联网上获取最新的信息。

<p>现在，我们图书馆里的参考书已经非常过时了。
nowadays, the reference book in our library are very outdated.

<p>我们的百科全书是八年前的了。

however, if each student can use the computer, we can get the newest facts and data of everything.

<p>购买更多的电脑将让学生可以随时使用它们。

<p>由于今天的生活节奏太快，无法等待，学生们通常需要大量立刻的信息。
while today&#x27;s life is too quick to stay, students usually need tons of information
==Since life today goes by== too quickly to wait, students usually need lots of information right away.</p>
<p>然而，有时要花很长时间才能找到一本书，而你认为这本书可能有你需要的信息的书。
however, sometimes it took a long time to find a book which you considered i might contain the information you needed
However, sometimes it takes like forever to identify a book that you think might have the information that you need in a library.</p>
<p>当人们去图书馆找书时，他们通常会发现图书馆根本没有这本书。</p>
<p>相反，用电脑搜索信息是即时的。</p>
<p>如果我们都有了电脑，我们就能更快地获取任何信息。</p>
<p>有了这些信息我们工作所需的信息，我们的成绩就会提高。</p>
<p>基于这些原因，我觉得购买更多的电脑将比购买更多的书本更有利于我们。</p>

<p>I am in favor of taxing unhealthy products, such as sugary drinks and junk food. The primary reason for my stance is that the revenue generated from these taxes can be utilized to fund public health initiatives and education programs that promote healthier lifestyles. By increasing the cost of unhealthy products, we can potentially discourage consumption, thereby reducing the prevalence of diet-related health issues like obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the taxes collected could be allocated towards expanding access to healthcare for low-income families, who are often the ones most reliant on these affordable, but unhealthy, food options. This approach addresses concerns about the regressive nature of such taxes by ensuring that the burden is offset by improved health outcomes and greater economic productivity in the long term.</p>
<p>Critics argue that these taxes could lead to increased costs for the average consumer, particularly those from lower-income brackets. However, I believe that the positive externalities of a healthier population, such as reduced healthcare costs and a more productive workforce, would outweigh the short-term financial hardship for some individuals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while it is crucial to consider the potential negative impacts of such policies, the benefits of taxing unhealthy products for the overall improvement of public health and economic welfare seem to outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>From my perspective, students should be given grades. Grades, when accompanied by constructive feedback, offer valuable insights into a student’s performance. This feedback is crucial for learning and development, as it guides students in understanding their mistakes and learning from them. It also provides a roadmap for both students and teachers to focus their efforts more effectively. By highlighting strengths and weaknesses, grades combined with feedback can significantly enhance a student’s learning experience.</p>
<p>While it’s true that grades can foster competition, this isn’t inherently negative. For instance, a study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that students who engage in healthy competition are more likely to develop resilience and a growth mindset. Competition, when framed positively, can motivate students to strive for excellence and can prepare them for real-world scenarios where performance is often measured against peers. The key is to balance this with collaborative learning opportunities that emphasize teamwork and collective achievement, showing that individual success does not have to come at the expense of others.</p>
<p>Moreover, grades serve as a standardized measure that can help identify areas where students need additional support. Without such benchmarks, it might be challenging for educators to tailor their teaching strategies effectively. For example, in countries like Finland, where grades are used in conjunction with personalized feedback, students consistently rank high in international assessments.</p>
<p>In summary, assigning grades to students does more good than harm. By combining grades with constructive feedback and fostering a balanced environment of competition and collaboration, educators can enhance both individual and collective academic success.</p>

<p>I completely align with Jake&#x27;s opinion that grades are the most effective way to measure students&#x27; comprehensive abilities and the effort they invest in their academic work.</p>
<p>manage time and handle pressure
prowess造诣；</p>
<p>Firstly, ==achieving high grades== requires students to study ==diligently== and thoroughly cover the subject matter. This preparation ==not only tests their knowledge but also their ability to manage time and handle pressure==. These skills are reflected in their final scores, demonstrating both academic prowess and resilience.</p>
<p>full spectrum全方位；</p>
<p>Critics argue that grades do not capture the full spectrum of a student&#x27;s abilities. However, in the real world, ==results often matter more than the process==. Employers and institutions ==typically focus on outcomes rather than the effort behind them==. Thus, grades serve as a realistic preparation for future professional expectations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while grades may not be a perfect measure of a student&#x27;s abilities, they provide a necessary benchmark ==for academic and professional success==. They motivate students to excel and prepare them for the competitive nature of the real world.</p>

<p>I completely align with Andrew&#x27;s opinion that we should not ==treat robots with the same level of politeness as we do humans==, due to the potential harm it could cause to our perception of real human interactions.</p>
<p>To elaborate, robots are ==essentially machines== designed to ==assist humans in performing== dangerous or complex tasks. While it is natural for us to develop a certain ==attachment== to ==frequently used== tools, this attachment is more about familiarity or nostalgia rather than genuine politeness. ==Projecting human emotions onto robots== can blur the distinction between humans and machines, ==leading to unrealistic expectations== about their capabilities and roles in society.</p>
<p>For instance, if children observe adults treating robots with the same courtesy as humans, they might grow up with a distorted understanding of social interactions, believing that machines can reciprocate human emotions. This could ==diminish the value of human empathy== and reduce the quality of human-to-human relationships. Therefore, ==maintaining a clear boundary== in how we interact with robots is ==crucial== for preserving the integrity of human social norms.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5">5<a href="#5" class="hash-link" aria-label="5的直接链接" title="5的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>I completely align with Andrew&#x27;s opinion that we shouldn&#x27;t treat robots with the same politeness as we do humans. The primary reason for my stance is that it ==could== potentially harm our perception of human interactions.</p>
<p>To elaborate, many people can easily ==develop attachments to== their possessions, such as cars and computers. If ==politeness towards robots== leads to an emotional attachment, it might distort our perception of human relationships. For instance, someone might start valuing interactions with robots over those with real people, which could lead to social isolation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if children ==observe== their parents treating robots with the same courtesy as humans, they might develop a distorted mindset that hinders normal human interactions. This could reduce the quality of their relationships and affect their social development.</p>
<p>In order to prevent these potential issues, we need to establish a clear boundary between robots and humans. ==While basic respect for robots as tools== is acceptable, equating them with humans could lead to significant social and psychological consequences.</p>

<p>I completely align with Andrew&#x27;s opinion that removing helmet regulations for cyclists could encourage more people to engage in cycling and use it as a convenient mode of transportation.</p>
<p>First, helmets are primarily effective in high-speed collisions, protecting cyclists from severe head injuries. However, in suburban areas where cycling speeds are generally lower, the likelihood of such high-speed crashes is reduced. ==In these cases, helmets may provide minimal additional safety benefits but can be uncomfortable and inconvenient for the rider.==</p>
<p>Second, strict helmet regulations might ==deter== people ==from== choosing cycling ==over== other forms of transportation. By removing these regulations, suburban governments can promote cycling as a healthier and more environmentally friendly mode of transport. Increased cycling can lead to various public health benefits, such as reduced obesity rates and lower carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Critics argue that helmet regulations play a crucial role in ==ensuring public safety==. ==While this is true to some extent==, it is essential to consider the broader impact of such regulations. Instead of implementing mandatory helmet laws, governments could focus on promoting helmet use through education and ==awareness campaigns.== This approach respects individual freedom while still emphasizing safety.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while safety is important, removing ==mandatory== helmet regulations can encourage more people to cycle, leading to significant health and environmental benefits. Governments should trust citizens to make informed decisions about their safety and focus on promoting voluntary helmet use.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that government ==subsidies== for electric vehicles will significantly increase their adoption and usage, given that ==traditional internal combustion engine cars== are often expensive to ==purchase and maintain==.</p>
<p>To elaborate, the ==production mechanics== of oil-based engines inherently drive up the cost of traditional cars. While consumers are often ==dissatisfied== with these high prices, government subsidies can ==make electric vehicles more affordable==. By financially supporting the development and purchase of electric vehicles, governments can lower the entry barrier for consumers.</p>
<p>For instance, many developing countries have implemented subsidy policies for electric cars. According to ==statistical== data from these countries, such ==initiatives== have successfully encouraged the adoption of electric vehicles in both the short and long term.</p>
<p>In conclusion, government subsidies not only ==make electric vehicles more accessible== but also promote a cleaner environment by ==reducing reliance on fossil fuels==. Therefore, I recommend that local governments consider this policy to foster a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that grading students should be based on both performance and effort, given that the purpose of education is not only to ==identify geniuses== in a certain field but also to promote a hard-working spirit.</p>
<p>To elaborate, good performance due to inherent capability should not ==be valued more than== diligent study to achieve high scores. Education should focus on the ==holistic== development of students, which includes both academic ability and robustness of mindset.</p>
<p>For example, a student with low grades could end up as a successful entrepreneur, ==while== a student with high grades might ==fall into drug addiction==. Moreover, giving grades ==based solely on== performance may lead to avoidable cheating. School teachers need to pay more attention to the virtues and integrity built ==during== the students&#x27; learning process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a balanced approach to grading that considers both performance and effort can better support students&#x27; overall development and prepare them for future challenges.</p>

<p>I completely align with Kelly&#x27;s opinion that educational computer games for young children are a good idea, ==considering that== these games combine both usefulness and engagement.</p>
<p>On one hand, children aged 2 to 8 years do not have ==vast== amounts of knowledge to study. What they truly need is a happy and peaceful environment that ==fosters a love for learning==. On the other hand, computer games, which are considered ==the sixth art form==, can provide ==a wealth of information that children need to familiarize themselves with== before they start school.</p>
<p>Critics argue that ==spending extended periods of time on screens== will cause inevitable damage to the eyes and ==affect vision range==. However, numerous studies have already proven that vision is mostly influenced by ==genetics== rather than screen time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, educational computer games not only offer a fun and interactive way for young children to learn but also prepare them for future academic challenges.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="10">10<a href="#10" class="hash-link" aria-label="10的直接链接" title="10的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>I firmly believe that educational computer games are beneficial for young children, as they ==seamlessly integrate== learning with play. Unlike traditional methods, these games ==capture children&#x27;s attention== in a unique way, ==making learning enjoyable and effective==.</p>
<p>Firstly, educational games can significantly ==enhance cognitive development== by presenting basic math and reading skills in an interactive format. This method not only makes learning fun ==but also== helps children ==retain== information better. For instance, a game that teaches counting with colorful animations and immediate feedback can be more ==engaging== than simple ==rote memorization==.</p>
<p>Secondly, in today&#x27;s digital age, ==familiarity with technology== from an early age is crucial. Allowing children to interact with educational software prepares them for a future where ==digital literacy== will be essential. This early exposure helps them become comfortable with technology, which is a ==vital== skill in the modern world.</p>
<p>Critics ==often== ==highlight the potential negative impact== of screen time on young children’s ==eyesight== and social skills. However, recent studies suggest that ==moderate screen== use does not significantly harm vision ==if balanced with== other activities. Furthermore, these games can be designed to encourage ==problem-solving and critical thinking==, which are important life skills.</p>

<p>I strongly support the idea that parents should encourage their teenage children to ==take up== part-time jobs. This experience is crucial for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, part-time jobs teach teenagers ==essential life skills== such as time management, responsibility, and teamwork. For instance, balancing work hours with school assignments helps students learn to ==prioritize tasks== effectively. This skill becomes invaluable in adulthood, where juggling multiple responsibilities is often a necessity.</p>
<p>Secondly, working part-time exposes teenagers to ==real-world scenarios==, ==imparting== a practical understanding of financial literacy. They learn the value of money, budgeting, and the importance of hard work. Such experiences foster a sense of independence and ==self-reliance==, preparing them for future challenges.</p>
<p>Critics argue that part-time jobs might ==distract students from== their academic ==pursuits==. However, I believe that ==the discipline and time management skills== acquired through part-time work can actually enhance academic performance. Moreover, the sense of accomplishment and confidence gained from earning their own money can be highly motivating for teenagers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the benefits of part-time jobs for teenagers ==far outweigh== the potential drawbacks. These jobs not only provide practical life skills but also prepare teenagers for the complexities of adult life. Therefore, parents should indeed encourage their teenage children to seek part-time employment.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="13">13<a href="#13" class="hash-link" aria-label="13的直接链接" title="13的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>Encouraging teenage children to take on part-time jobs is an invaluable step in preparing them for adulthood. This approach offers multiple benefits that are essential for their holistic development.</p>
<p>To begin with, part-time jobs serve as a practical avenue for teenagers to develop critical life skills, such as time management, responsibility, and teamwork. For instance, ==managing work schedules alongside academic commitments== forces them to ==hone their ability== to prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively. These skills are not only crucial for academic success but also for personal and professional life in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, part-time employment introduces teenagers to the fundamentals of financial literacy. By earning their own money, they gain an understanding of the value of hard work, budgeting, and financial planning. This early exposure to financial responsibilities ==fosters a sense of independence== and prepares them for financial challenges they may face in adulthood.</p>
<p>Some may argue that part-time jobs could distract students from their studies. However, I believe that the opposite is true. The discipline and organizational skills required to balance work and school can enhance academic performance. Moreover, ==the confidence and sense of accomplishment== that come from earning their own income can serve as a powerful motivator for further academic and personal achievements.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the government should focus on offering free job training rather than merely providing financial support. ==While== direct ==monetary== assistance can temporarily ==alleviate financial hardships==, it does not ==address the root cause== of unemployment. Free job training, on the other hand, equips individuals with market-relevant skills, making them more competitive in the evolving job market.</p>
<p>For instance, as automation and AI continue to advance, many traditional jobs are becoming ==obsolete==. By investing in training programs for ==emerging fields== such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and renewable energy, the government can help displaced workers transition into new, sustainable careers. This approach ==not only benefits individuals== by enhancing their employability ==but also contributes to the overall economic development== by creating ==a more skilled workforce==.</p>
<p>Furthermore, job training ==fosters a sense of empowerment and self-sufficiency== among individuals, ==as opposed to== the dependency that might arise from receiving direct financial aid. In the long run, a skilled and adaptable workforce is essential for economic resilience and growth, making free job training a more effective and sustainable solution.</p>

<p>I agree with Claire that public funds should not be used to support artists.</p>
<p>One of the main purposes of having artwork in our lives is to provide beauty and enjoyment, so if the works of artists truly fulfill that need, they will have enough buyers who are willing to pay and support them.</p>
<p>For ==those whose work is not recognized and appreciated==, public funds will only serve as a hindrance, delaying their choice of changing their careers. Paul mentions artwork that governments purchase to make public spaces enjoyable, but I don&#x27;t believe this contradicts Claire&#x27;s opinion.</p>
<p>Any ==statues or murals== that governments acquire must reflect the preferences of most taxpayers. That&#x27;s why they got approved in the first place. Thus, these public funds should not be regarded as money intended for supporting artists, but rather as the price paid for acquiring something the public finds enjoyable.</p>

<p>I agree with Andrew that traditional media, such as books, has much less influence on individuals today compared to digital platforms like television.</p>
<p>Living in an era of ==information explosion==, people today simply don&#x27;t have enough time to absorb all the available information and knowledge. This is why they turn to television and social media for ==concise reports== and analyses that are not only easily understandable but also less time-consuming.</p>
<p>No matter where you go, you see more people looking at screens than those ==immersed in== books or newspapers.</p>
<p>Claire mentions that ==in-depth knowledge== from traditional media tends to have a greater impact on individuals, but this is only the case with those who enjoy reading. Younger generations who daily consume content on platforms like Facebook and TikTok, however, are more likely to be influenced by these sources due to their ==audio -visual nature==, which makes information easier to comprehend, remember, and share.</p>

<p>I believe that Claire&#x27;s suggestion of replacing grass with other plants that require less maintenance is a practical choice for saving money. If parks in cities are covered by plants that do not need to be cut very frequently, the budget allocated for hiring workers to do the upkeep job can be lowered considerably, but people can still enjoy the beautiful looks of green plants and the oxygen they produce. It&#x27;s a win-win situation. Paul&#x27;s proposal, however, needs to be considered after doing more observation. He talks about seeing many city hall employees standing there and doing nothing, but it is possible that he didn&#x27;t go there during peak hours. When deciding how many people to hire, the city hall must consider the maximum capacity they need to handle. Some employees may not be busy when Paul was there, but they could be necessary in peak hours.</p>

<p> I agree with Andrew that big companies should play a major role in protecting the environment.
 
 The impact a factory ==far exceeds== the collective contribution of thousands of individuals, and requiring a factory to change costs much less time and effort than trying to persuade thousands of people to cooperate.
 
 Supervising companies will also be much easier than monitoring individuals. That&#x27;s why large companies are usually the first to be regulated to stop ==environmental contamination==.
 
 Claire talks about the examples individuals can set for a green lifestyle, but I see ==limited evidence supporting it==. Most consumers are only sensitive to price, so they purchase environmentally-friendly products like electric cars mainly because of their lower prices or the better quality and performance. they offer for the same amount of money, not because of their zero carbon emission.
 
 Expecting individuals to take the lead on environmental protection is not a promising plan.</p>

<p>I believe that imposing environmental taxes on air travel is an effective way to address air pollution.</p>
<p>Like Andrew says, people are going to take less polluting modes of transportation due to the extra fees they have to pay for traveling by air. That means if air companies do not invest enough money in developing new and more environmentally friendly engines, they will not even be able to stay in business.</p>
<p>Actually, we&#x27;ve seen how effective such green taxes can be in the car industry already. However, I don&#x27;t agree with Claire&#x27;s opinion that customers should not bear the cost. Without their frequent use of the existing pollution transportation, the environment would not be so heavily contaminated.</p>
<p>Once customers realize that using polluting transportation can be more expensive, they are likely to choose ==airlines== with less polluting technologies. As a result, their choices will also contribute to the reduction of air pollution</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/English/miscellaneous/writing phrases"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">上一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">writing phrases</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/English/miscellaneous/writing"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">下一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">writing</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#121212" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">121212</a></li><li><a href="#1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">1</a></li><li><a href="#2" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">2</a></li><li><a href="#3" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">3</a></li><li><a href="#1-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">1</a></li><li><a href="#2-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">2</a></li><li><a href="#3-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">3</a></li><li><a href="#4" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">4</a></li><li><a href="#5" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">5</a></li><li><a href="#6" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">6</a></li><li><a href="#7" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">7</a></li><li><a href="#8" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">8</a></li><li><a href="#9" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">9</a></li><li><a href="#10" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">10</a></li><li><a href="#12" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">12</a></li><li><a href="#13" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">13</a></li><li><a href="#14" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">14</a></li><li><a href="#14-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">14</a></li><li><a href="#15" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">15</a></li><li><a href="#16" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">16</a></li><li><a href="#1-7" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">1 7</a></li><li><a href="#17" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">17</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/intro">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 JW238, Inc.
