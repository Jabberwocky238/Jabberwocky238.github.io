On the contrary, the lecturer argues that this statement is false. This is due to the fact that recent research found that they had fur, which can make them have metabolism similar to the warm-blooded animals. Therefore, it is wrong to say that pterosaurs were not capable of powered flight because of their metabolism."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another reason that the author in the reading argues is that their weight was too heavy to stay aloft and fly. In contrast, the lecturer claims that this argument is also ==erroneous==. The reason for this is that even though their size was so big, their weight was not heavy. For example, since their bones were hallow, their weight of body was so light that they were able to fly. Thus, the idea that they could not fly owing to their weight is obviously wrong."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The final reason that the reading goes on to explain is that fossils of pterosaurs suggest that they had small and weak leg muscles, which means that they were not able to launch themselves into the air. On the other hand, the professor contends that this explanation does not make sense. This is mainly because although it is true that birds' two limbs are used to jump or run in order to launch themselves, pterosaurs used four limbs instead of two limbs. As a result, their muscle legs were strong enough to jump high and run fast, making themselves launch into the air."})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>h});var n=o(96540);const s={},r=n.createContext(s);function a(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function h(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:a(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
