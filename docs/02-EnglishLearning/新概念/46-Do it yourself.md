<p>So great is our passion for doing things for ourselves that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labor. No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for there are countless do-it-yourself publications.</p>
<p>我们对为自己做事的热情如此之高，以至于我们越来越不依赖专业劳动。没有人可以再以对某个主题的无知为借口了，因为有无数的自己动手的出版物。</p>
<p>Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes. Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying out their own gardens, building garages and making furniture. Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers. Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent-up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.</p>
<p>有了合适的工具和材料，新婚夫妇愉快地开始装修自己的房子。尤其是男性，他们会在闲暇时间花上几个小时安装自己的壁炉，布置自己的花园，建造车库和制作家具。一些真正热衷于电脑的人甚至自己制造电脑。商店迎合自己动手的热潮，不仅为新手提供特别的咨询服务，还为消费者提供可以在家组装的零件。这些东西为被压抑的创造力提供了一个很好的出口，但不幸的是，并非所有人都是天生的勤杂工。</p>
<p>Some wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything. Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics.</p>
<p>有些妻子倾向于相信他们的丈夫足智多谋，什么事情都能解决。即使是那些几乎不会把钉子钉直的人，也应该是天生的电工、木匠、水管工和机械师。</p>
<p>When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some women assume that their husbands will somehow put things right.</p>
<p>当电灯熔断、家具摇晃、管道堵塞或吸尘器无法工作时，一些女性认为她们的丈夫会以某种方式纠正问题。</p>
<p>The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. It is a question of pride as much as anything else.</p>
<p>“自己动手”游戏最糟糕的一点是，有时即使是男人也会生活在一种错觉中，认为自己什么都能做，即使他们一再被证明是错的。这和其他任何事情一样，都是一个骄傲的问题。</p>
<p>Last spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawnmower. It had broken down the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it. I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself.</p>
<p>去年春天，我妻子建议我叫一个男人来看看我们的割草机。它在前一个夏天坏了，虽然我答应要修理它，但我一直没有时间。我听不到这个建议，说我自己修理。</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon I holed the machine into the garden and had a close look at it. As far as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment. A turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil, and it would be as good as new.</p>
<p>一个星期六的下午，我把机器钻到花园里，仔细看了一眼。据我所见，它只需要轻轻调整一下。这里拧一圈螺丝，那里拧紧一点，滴一滴油，它就会像新的一样好。</p>
<p>Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple. The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it. The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once made up a lawnmower. But I was extremely pleased with myself. I had traced the cause of the trouble.</p>
<p>修理工作不可避免地不是那么简单。割草机坚决不肯割草，所以我决定把它拆了。花园里很快就堆满了曾经构成割草机的金属块。但我对自己非常满意。我已经找到了麻烦的原因。</p>
<p>One of the links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped. After buying a new chain, I was faced with the unsurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together again. I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had reassembled it. For the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not seem to fit anywhere.</p>
<p>驱动轮子的链条上有一个链环断裂了。买了一条新的链条后，我面临着一项艰巨的任务，那就是把令人困惑的拼图重新组装起来。我并不惊讶地发现，在我重新组装后，这台机器仍然无法工作。原因很简单，我只剩下几个形状奇怪的金属块，它们似乎哪儿都放不下。</p>
<p>I gave up in despair. The weeks passed and the grass grew. When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow.</p>
<p>我绝望地放弃了。几周过去了，草长了起来。当我妻子唠叨着要我做点什么时，我告诉她要么我得买一台新割草机，要么让草长出来。</p>
<p>Simply just to say, our house is now surrounded by a jungle. Buried somewhere in deep grass, there is a rusting lawnmower which I have promised to repair one day.</p>
<p>简单地说，我们的房子现在被丛林包围了。埋在深草丛中的某个地方，有一台生锈的割草机，我答应有一天会修理它。</p>
