<p>In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences. Most of them, wildly improbable.</p>
<p>在十九世纪，小说家会通过向读者呈现一系列巧合来结束他的故事。其中大多数，难以置信。</p>
<p>Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maid servant was really the hero's mother. A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time and wickedly plotting to bring about the hero's downfall, and so on.</p>
<p>读者们欣然接受了这样一个事实：一个默默无闻的女仆真的是主人公的母亲。一个失散多年的兄弟，被认为已经去世，但他一直活着，并邪恶地策划导致英雄的垮台等等。</p>
<p>Modern readers would find such naive solutions totally unacceptable. Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but a nineteenth-century novelist would find incredible.</p>
<p>现代读者会发现这种天真的解决方案是完全不能接受的。然而，在现实生活中，环境有时确实会带来巧合，除了19世纪的小说家之外，任何人都会觉得不可思议。</p>
<p>When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Busmann, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Busmann commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz poured scorn on the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war.</p>
<p>当我还是个男孩的时候，我的祖父告诉我，德国出租车司机Franz Busmann是如何找到一个被认为在20年前被杀的兄弟的。在与妻子徒步旅行时，他停下来与一名工人交谈。接着，巴斯曼太太评论说，这个工人和她丈夫长得很像，甚至暗示他可能是他的兄弟。弗兰兹对这个想法嗤之以鼻，指出他的兄弟在战争中阵亡。</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Busmann was fully <span class="origin-text">acquainted<span class="translated-text">熟悉</span></span> with this story, she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Busmann. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Busmann and he really was Franz's long-lost brother. When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive.</p>
<p>虽然巴斯曼太太对这个故事很熟悉，但她认为她有可能是对的。几天后，她派了一个男孩去找工人，问他是否叫汉斯·布斯曼。不用说，这个人的名字叫汉斯·布斯曼，他确实是弗兰兹失散多年的兄弟。当兄弟俩团聚时，汉斯解释了他还活着的原因。</p>
<p>After having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit. The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed and no one in the neighborhood knew what had become of the inhabitants. Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid, Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.</p>
<p>在战争接近尾声时受伤后，他被送往医院，并与部队分离。医院遭到轰炸，汉斯步行返回德国西部。与此同时，他的部队丢失了，他的所有记录都被销毁了。汉斯回到了他的家，但房子被炸了，附近没有人知道居民的情况。假设他的家人在空袭中丧生，汉斯在50英里外的一个村庄安顿下来，从此一直住在那里。</p>
