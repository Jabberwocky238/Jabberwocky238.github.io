<p>In democratic countries, any efforts to restrict the freedom of the press are rightly condemned. However, this freedom can easily be abused. Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political events.</p>
<p>在民主国家，任何限制新闻自由的努力都受到应有的谴责。然而，这种自由很容易被滥用。人们的故事往往比政治事件更能引起公众的关注。</p>
<p>Though we may enjoy reading about the lives of others, it is extremely doubtful whether we would equally enjoy reading about ourselves. Acting on the contention that facts are sacred, reporters can cause untold suffering to individuals by publishing details about their private lives.</p>
<p>尽管我们可能喜欢阅读别人的生活，但我们是否也会同样喜欢阅读自己的生活，这是非常值得怀疑的。根据事实是神圣的论点，记者公布个人私生活的细节，可能会给个人带来难以言喻的痛苦。</p>
<p>Newspapers exert such tremendous influence that they cannot only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people, but can even overthrow a government.</p>
<p>报纸的影响力如此之大，以至于它们不仅能给普通人的生活带来重大改变，甚至可以推翻政府。</p>
<p>The story of a poor family that acquired fame and fortune overnight dramatically illustrates the power of the press. The family lived in Aberdeen, a small town of 23,000 inhabitants in South Dakota.</p>
<p>一个贫穷家庭一夜之间名利双收的故事戏剧性地说明了媒体的力量。这家人住在南达科他州一个有23000名居民的小镇阿伯丁。</p>
<p>As the parents had five children, life was a perpetual struggle against poverty. They were expecting their sixth child and were faced with even more pressing economic problems.</p>
<p>由于父母有五个孩子，生活是与贫困作持久斗争的过程。他们正怀着第六个孩子，面临着更为紧迫的经济问题。</p>
<p>If they had only had one more child, the fact would have passed unnoticed. They would have continued to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity.</p>
<p>如果他们只多生一个孩子，事实就会被忽视。他们会继续与经济困难作斗争，默默无闻地生活。</p>
<p>But they suddenly became the parents of quintuplets, four girls and a boy, an event which radically changed their lives. The day after the birth of the five children, an airplane arrived in Aberdeen bringing 60 reporters and photographers.</p>
<p>但他们突然成为了五胞胎、四个女孩和一个男孩的父母，这一事件彻底改变了他们的生活。五个孩子出生后的第二天，一架飞机带着60名记者和摄影师抵达阿伯丁。</p>
<p>The rise to fame was swift. Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the country. Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to published stories and photographs.</p>
<p>名气迅速上升。电视摄像机和报纸把新闻带给全国每一个人。报纸和杂志向这家人提供了巨额资金，以获得出版故事和照片的独家权利。</p>
<p>Gifts poured in not only from unknown people but from baby food and soap manufacturers who wished to advertise their products. The old farmhouse the family lived in was to be replaced by a new $500,000 home.</p>
<p>礼物纷至沓来，不仅有不知名的人，还有希望为自己的产品做广告的婴儿食品和肥皂制造商。这家人住的旧农舍将被一栋价值50万美元的新房子所取代。</p>
<p>Reporters kept pressing for interviews so lawyers had to be employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press conferences. While the five babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in a hospital nursery, their parents were paying the price for fame.</p>
<p>记者们不断要求采访，因此不得不聘请律师在新闻发布会上为这家人代言。当这五个婴儿还在医院托儿所的氧气帐篷里安静地睡觉时，他们的父母正在为名声付出代价。</p>
<p>It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. They had become the victims of commercialization. For their names had acquired a market value. Instead of being five new family members, these children had immediately become a commodity.</p>
<p>他们再也不可能过上正常的生活了。他们成了商业化的牺牲品。因为他们的名字已经有了市场价值。这些孩子不再是五个新的家庭成员，而是立即成为一种商品。</p>
