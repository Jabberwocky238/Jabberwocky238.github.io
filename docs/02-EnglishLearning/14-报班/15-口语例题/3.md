谈话中回电话有两种
一种是不经对方允许的，一种是对方同意的
任何时间都有紧急情况发生
不能为了迎合别人而忽视潜在的紧急情况

There are two types of situations to response or check text messages.
The first one is asking for the permission of others, the another one is not asking.

And as we all know, emergencies can occur anytime anywhere.
So it is not neccessary for us to neglect the text messages all the time.
Asking for a polite temporary absence can resolve this problem in a good manner.

有自由权但你还有责任
你不能撒手不管你的工作，这是你的事业
一个合格的企业不会在你度假的时候骚扰你，而是让其他在职人员承担这个责任
所以这或许是你鉴定企业好坏以及是否继续留下工作的好机会。

although everybody have their rights to neglect their work stuff during vacation,
but it is important to remember that you still have responsibility for your own career.
You cannot neglect everything as if you have nothing to do with that.

But ironically, a qualified enterprise will not ==harass you== while you are on vacation, but instead hold other employees responsible for this.

So this may be a good opportunity for you to assess ==the quality of the company== and ==whether to continue working here==.

It's this synergy that reinforces the ties between employees, and makes working collaborately more efficiently in the long term.
