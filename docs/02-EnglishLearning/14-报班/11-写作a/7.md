Andrew and Kelly have expressed their differing ==viewpoints== on educational computer games. 

While I understand Kelly's argument regarding the advantages of educational computer games, I tend to agree more with Andrew's perspective, which ==questions== the ==necessity and appropriateness== of children engaging in such activities. 

It is widely recognized that there exist numerous effective traditional study methods and educational tools beyond computer games. 

Children between the ages of 2 and 8 are still developing their self-control abilities, which can lead to excessive screen time and a ==neglect== of other important activities. 

This overindulgence may result in a ==sedentary lifestyle==, ==near-sightedness==, and a reduced inclination to socialize, all of which can ==have detrimental effects on== children's physical and mental health.
