I am holding a different opinion with Kelly's statement of grading students soly based on performance. 
In my view, professors should consider both performance and students' effort when assigning grades. 

Specifically, factoring in effort acknowledges the importance of ==determination, perseverance, and the learning process itself,== which can serve as significant motivators for students to work diligently and strive for improvement over time. 

Conversely, if grades only reflect academic performance without considering the effort expended, they may fail to account for variations in ==student effort, learning challenges, or personal circumstances== that can profoundly impact performance. 

==This one-dimensional approach== can sometimes discourage struggling students and ==dampen their interest and attitude toward learning.== 

Therefore, a more ==holistic整体的；全面的== grading approach aligns better with the principles of fairness and student development.
