I agree with Claire's perspective on the importance of teenagers engaging in part-time jobs. Such experiences not only encourage efficient time management but also teach children valuable financial responsibility skills. 

In today's increasingly comfortable living conditions, young people sometimes ==overlook the challenges and efforts required to earn money.== 

Part-time employment allows teenagers to ==firsthand experience== the physical and emotional demands of making money, such as working in a restaurant, washing dishes, or ==delivering mail over long distances==. 

These experiences provide them with a direct understanding of the difficulties of life.

As a result, engaging in part-time jobs can ==help prevent== inappropriate behaviors such as ==excessive spending== on video games and overspending. 

==It instills a strong sense of the value of money in their minds==, encouraging them to appreciate what they have and make wise spending choices. 

==Ultimately==, teenagers can learn to ==treasure their hard-earned money== and allocate it responsibly.

I firmly concur with Claire's viewpoint on the valuable time management ==skill -> skills== learned from part-time job.
From my perspective, 
getting a part-time job not only ==boardens== the horizon but also ==promote== the development of independent personality.
==broadens==, promotes

It is widely acknowledged that the real society is far away from ==what have been taught -> what is taught== in school and what we see on the internet.
By engaging in a part-time job, ==children -> teenagers== can have a close contact with reality, develop important life skills and establish a correct ==recognition -> understanding== of society.

Additionally, part-time job provides a platform to ==train -> hone== financial management skills and contact with strangers, 
which ==promote -》fosters== the development of self-independence and responsibility.

Ironically, the slightly unessesary distraction derived from part-time job is negligible compared with the substantial real-life lessons ==gained== .

I wholeheartedly agree with Claire’s stance concerning the invaluable time management skills ==acquired through== part-time employment. In my view, such work not only ==expands a teenager’s outlook== but also nurtures the cultivation of a self-reliant personality.

It is a widely held belief that ==the complexities of the real world== ==starkly== contrast with the curriculum of our schools and the virtual realm of the internet. 

Part-time employment allows teenagers to immerse themselves in the practicalities of life, fostering the acquisition of ==vital life skills== and shaping a profound comprehension of societal structures.

Moreover, ==these jobs serve as a crucible for refining financial acumen and social interaction abilities==, thereby enhancing a young person’s autonomy and sense of duty. 
Ironically, any minor distractions that may arise from part-time work ==pale in comparison to== the rich tapestry of life lessons it imparts.
