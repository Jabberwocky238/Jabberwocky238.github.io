I concur with Kelly's ==insightful point== regarding the advantages of working for established companies and their reputations. 

In my perspective, being a part of a well-known, large organization not only provides access to ==the company's extensive business network== but also offers ==comprehensive personal and professional development opportunities== in the long term. 

It's undeniable that established companies ==typically== have more ==efficient systems== for employee development and growth. 

==Working alongside experienced colleagues== in a large company allows undergraduates and employees to ==acquire valuable knowledge and expertise==. 

Furthermore, having a ==well-established and organized== working system, a ==relatively less hectic pace of work相对不忙碌的工作== in large companies is ==granted compared to== start-ups, which allows employees more time to pursue their own interests and ==maintain a healthier work-life balance==.

老公司好
1，老公司的声誉对个人职业发展有帮助
2，老公司让业务流程清晰，让新人快速成长，积累技术和能力，快速在社会上立足
反之，新公司对综合能力的要求更高，生手很难直接胜任，并且通常没有高薪水，对经济不自立的人来说并不友好

I firmly concur with Kelly's viewpoint concerning the amount of respect that ==established company already have.==
==established companies already have==
==the respect that established companies already possess==

From my perspective, working for a established company as new university graduates not only has a positive impact on our individual career development but also our competence and technology.
==enhances our skills and competencies==

It is no denying of the fact that established companies have set up a pipeline for every employee. With being familiar with this pipeline,
==There is no denying the fact that== 

we can acquire a better understanding of our job, ==accumulate the technology ability== and make a great progress very quickly.
==accumulate technological skills.==

More importantly, the reputation of established company usually plays an important role on the employee's resume, which ==stands for the competence and virtuosity of this person==. 
==symbolizing the individual’s competence and expertise.== 
==which represents the competence and character of this person.==

Undoubtedly,
It is no doubt that the experience in big exterprise will prolong the career life span.
==experience in a large enterprise== 
==extend one’s career lifespan==

Conversely, the deep understanding of the commercial field and powerful technology ability of employees are usually expected by a small start-up company, 
==the in-depth understanding of the commercial landscape（商业环境）==
==robust technical skills==

which means that ==such requirement of comprehensive ability is too high to be fulfiled by a fresh man.==
==such a demand for comprehensive ability is too high for a newcomer to meet.==
A are demands that may be ==too challenging for a recent graduate to fulfill.==
