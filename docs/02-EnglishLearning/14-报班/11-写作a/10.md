Claire's assertion that governments should ==refrain== from promoting tourism in remote regions holds merit. 

From my perspective, not only does the development of tourism in such areas ==disrupt== the lives of local residents, but it can also have detrimental effects on the local environment. 

It is widely recognized that tourism often places a significant environmental burden on the regions it touches. 

Specifically, some tourists may engage in ==unsanitary== practices such as littering, spitting, and even defecating in scenic spots. 

These irresponsible behaviors ==invariably exacerbate the environmental challenges== faced by these remote areas. 

The more effort governments invest in developing tourism in such regions, the greater the environmental pollution and strain ==endured== by these locales. 

In summary, we should not underestimate ==the adverse impact== that promoting tourism in certain regions can have, both on the environment and the local communities.
