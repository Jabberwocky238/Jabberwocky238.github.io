I concur with Paul's perspective ==on== ==the unnecessary nature of journal writing activities== in the educational context. 

In my view, 
implementing ==mandatory强制的== diary writing can not only burden teachers and students, 
as Paul pointed out, 
but also ==dampen students' enthusiasm for learning==. 

It is widely recognized that ==cultivating a genuine interest in learning== is the most effective approach for students. 

When journals are made compulsory, students who do not ==have a natural inclination== for writing may ==view it as a chore作为一件苦差事== and rush through it. 

This rushed approach is unlikely to foster a genuine love for learning. 

==Instead==, it adds unnecessary pressure to young children, ==contradicting== the initial goal of education. 

As a result, 
it is imperative to thoroughly consider the feasibility and impact of such requirements on students' learning experiences, 
ensuring that educational strategies genuinely promote enthusiasm for learning rather than impose unnecessary burdens.

While I understand Paul's opinion that considering the joural writing as a time-costing task,

While I understand Paul’s perspective that ==journal writing is considered a time-consuming task==

I tend to agree more with Clarie's viewpoint, which emphasize the advantages of fast feedback and individual developement.
which ==emphasizes== the advantages of ==prompt feedback及时反馈== and individual development.

There is no denying ~~of~~ the fact that everyone ==want== to establish a positive feedback loop when studying.

By ==keep== a journal writing habit, we can reflect our lessons and knowledge periodically, expose the flaws we have and fix them on time.

More importantly, after developing a habit of keeping joural writing, 
we will be able to ==locate our potential weak points on our own.==
==identify our potential weak points independently.==

Ironically, the tedious and boring start time is anything but nothing compared to such long-term benefits.
==the initial tedious and boring phase== is ==negligible微不足道的== compared to the ==substantial== long-term benefits.
