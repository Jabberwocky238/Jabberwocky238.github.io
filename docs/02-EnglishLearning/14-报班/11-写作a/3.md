Kelly and Paul mentioned two important environmental problems our society is facing ==and made good points to support their arguments==. 
As it for me, I believe the ==depletion== of fossil fuels has been an important environmental problem ==in the past decades==. 

Burning fossil fuels will create ==hazardous== smoke that pollutes the air and also damages human health. 

Also, the process of exploiting traditional energy sources is also ==detrimental== to the environment. 

The most effective solution to this problem, from my perspective, is to encourage ==tapping and using== of clean energy sources such as tidal energy, wind energy, and solar energy. These energy sources are renewable and will not cause any environmental pollution.
