I concur with Claire's insightful perspective concerning ==the balance between work and leisure== in 20 years. 

In my view, achieving more leisure time and shorter work hours is not solely dependent on a wealthier society but also on the advancements in technology expected in the next 20 years. 

It is widely recognized that science and technology form the foundation of a nation's strength and have far-reaching impacts on its development. 

By fostering the growth of technology experts, innovations such as automated devices, robots, and artificial intelligence can be developed and ==integrated into== workplaces, potentially replacing human ==labor==. 

Consequently, people in the future may not need to invest nearly 8 hours a day in their work, affording them more opportunities for rest and pursuing their interests. 

Therefore, the prospect of reduced work hours and increased leisure time ==becomes more attainable with== the ongoing improvement of technology.
