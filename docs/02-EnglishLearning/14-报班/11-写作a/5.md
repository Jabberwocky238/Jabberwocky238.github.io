Kelly and Claire have shared their perspectives on the use of available urban space, and I firmly believe that utilizing this space as green land can be highly beneficial for the city. 

It's widely acknowledged that environmental pollution in urban areas has become increasingly severe in recent years. 

==By repurposing available urban space into green land==, we can ==make significant strides== in improving environmental sustainability within these urban environments. 

Green plants ==play a pivotal role in== absorbing carbon dioxide, thereby helping to ==mitigate the adverse effects== of climate change. 

They also play a crucial role in reducing the urban heat island effect, leading to improved air quality and a more comfortable living environment, especially during the hot months. 

Moreover, green spaces can serve as natural habitats ==for local flora and fauna==, actively promoting urban biodiversity. 

==Taken together==, these numerous ==merits== strongly ==support the decision to prioritize== green land usage for the betterment of our cities.
