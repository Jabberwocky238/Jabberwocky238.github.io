==I resonate with Andrew's perspective== regarding the ==accountability责任== that attendance policies aim to promote. 

However, I also believe that allowing for optional attendance can contribute to the development of students' responsibility. 

It is evident that remote work has become increasingly ==prevalent== since the pandemic era, ==with more individuals and companies embracing this flexible approach to work.== 

In such a setting, ==individuals within a group or a corporate environment== often manage their tasks effectively, following their preferred work habits and schedules. Incorporating this optional attendance policy in colleges can encourage students to plan ahead and develop essential time management skills. 

This approach enables them to optimize their schedules and enhance their learning outcomes. 

Ultimately, it imparts valuable lessons about ==taking ownership of their studies==, rather than attending classes merely ==for the sake of== meeting attendance requirements.
