Burning fossil fuels will create hazardous smoke that pollutes the air and also damages human health. Also, the process of exploiting traditional energy sources is also detrimental to the environment. 

清洁能源
The most effective solution to this problem, from my perspective, is to encourage tapping and using of clean energy sources such as tidal energy, wind energy, and solar energy. These energy sources are renewable and will not cause any environmental pollution.

环境污染变严重
It's widely acknowledged that environmental pollution in urban areas has become increasingly severe in recent years. By repurposing available urban space into green land, we can make significant strides in improving environmental sustainability within these urban environments.

Green plants play a pivotal role in absorbing carbon dioxide, thereby helping to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. They also play a crucial role in reducing the urban heat island effect, leading to improved air quality and a more comfortable living environment, especially during the hot months. Moreover, green spaces can serve as natural habitats for local flora and fauna, actively promoting urban biodiversity. 

While promoting the use of public transportation is a practical and persuasive short-term strategy to reduce emissions, it's important to acknowledge that public transportation systems also produce exhaust gases, including carbon dioxide, to varying degrees. 

By investing in companies that manufacture electric vehicles and offering incentives to potential buyers, we can stimulate the adoption of environmentally friendly, zero-emission electric cars. 

This approach holds the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector and may influence people's purchasing habits and preferences on cars.
