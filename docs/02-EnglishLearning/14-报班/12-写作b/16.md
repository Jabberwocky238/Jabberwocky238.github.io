While both Paul and Claire show their perspectives towards great approaches to make the transition to a new school smoothly, It is establing the public online platform that offers a window into a better understanding of the new school.

新生入学往往找不到可信赖的朋友，并且他也不清楚他需要什么。
The arrival of new students often finds them unable to ==discern== trustworthy companions ==amidst the throng在人群中==, and they remain perplexed about their own needs. 

大多数人都是浑浑噩噩，随波逐流。
The majority seem to ==drift aimlessly==, ==carried along by the tide of conformity==.

通过建立一个公众讨论平台，高年级学生和低年级学生可以就一些公共问题进行讨论，比如周年活动，学校政策，老师评价等。
By establishing a public ==forum for discourse==, senior students and their younger counterparts can engage in meaningful discussions on various ==communal issues社区问题==, such as anniversary events, school policies, and teacher evaluations.

更重要的是，让新生找到了方向和可信赖的战友，在陌生的环境之不至于感到恐惧和迷茫。
More significantly, this initiative ==guides== the newcomers in discovering ==their path and reliable allies==, thus ==alleviating the sense of dread and disorientation== that often accompanies unfamiliarity of a new environment.

通过这种方法，可以显著加速学生切换学校的进程，并且让学校更加和谐友爱。
Through this approach, the transition of students into ==the school community== is markedly expedited, ==fostering an== 
==atmosphere of harmony== and ==camaraderie== ==within the educational institution==.
