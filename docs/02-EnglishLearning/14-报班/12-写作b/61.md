Both Kelly and Paul show their amazing perspectives on important eating habits. As it for me, eating more vegetables provides us with not only plant fiber that prompts the digesting process but also numerous nutrition that human need.

It is widely acknowledged that residents of cities usually hurry on working and pay less attention on daily diet plan. Thus, nobody is truly healthy due to lack of nutrition. By eating more healthy vegetables, people will gain enough fiber and vitamins which satisfy the amount of human body intrinsically need for each day, ensuring the health and operating of body. Ironically, the most likely reason why people usually get sick and have to go to hospital is unbalanced diet habits.
