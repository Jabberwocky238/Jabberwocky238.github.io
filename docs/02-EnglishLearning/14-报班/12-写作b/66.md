休息，鉴定自己的事，独立，个人成长，不要被干扰
讽刺的是，很难，所以需要刻意

I firmly concur with Andrew’s viewpoint regarding the substantial advantages that psychological break can offer. In my opinion, opting for taking breaks for a period of time not only furnishes us with abundant time to concentrate on our own careers but also helps to the development of independent personality.

While focusing on ourselves serves as a fundamental way to individual success, taking a break from the news offers us enough time to achieve this goal. Meanwhile, it also offers a chance for us to nurture self-independence and critical thinking, instead we will be overwhelmed by the flood of information. Ironically, in this digital era, staying rational in the irrational Internet environment is deemed very difficult for each person.
