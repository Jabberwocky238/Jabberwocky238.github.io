The author introduces three theories to explain the origin of the Voynich manuscript. However, the lecturer disagrees with those theories and ==provides several reasons to demonstrate his point of views.==

First, the author mentions that the manuscript is a work on scientific or magical subject and Ascham has been identified as the author of it. 
And yet, the lecturer ==opposes== that Ascham is an ordinary physician and botanist and the plants in his book are rather common. 
Based on his works, it seems unlikely that he has the knowledge of creating those complex content in the manuscript. 
Therefore, Ascham is not the one who wrote the manuscript. Â 

Second, the author states that the manuscript is a fake magical book and was created by Kelley who wanted to sell to a wealthy noble. 
On the other hand, the lecturer ==refutes== that it took lots of care to make a fake one seem so real and people were easy to fool at that time, 
so it's possible for Kelley to just create a simple work rather than the manuscript. 
==Thus==, it's unlikely that the manuscript was made by Kelley.

Third, the author believes that the manuscript is a modern fake created by Voynich himself to receive an attractive offer. 
Once again, the lecturer challenges that people used modern method to find the ink on the manuscript 400 years ==prior to 1912.== 
It's possible for Voynich to use the vellum to create a fake one but not the ink.
Hence, ==it seems doubtful== that Voynich created the manuscript.

The reading passage have shown three possible origins of the quot;Voynich manuscriptquot;, which resembles manuscripts written in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. However, the professor in the lecture opposes each of them.

First, the passage argues that the manuscript is a genuine scientific or magical work written by Anthony Ascham in a complex secret code. By contrast, the professor claims that this assumption doesn't fit Anthony Ascham, because his manuscripts mostly contain his original ideas of medic, which will not be elaborately coded.

Second, the passage proclaims that this manuscript is a fake which has no real meaning. However, the professor challenges this point by the fact that it does not need to put so much work into making a fake for Kelley, considering that people in sixteenth-century Europe is quite easy to fool. Therefore it is not necessary to make it complex 8by create secret codes.

Third, the passage contends that the manuscript is a modern fake created by Wilfrid M. Voynich because he wants to receive an attractive offer. Nonetheless, the professor argues that the ink both inside and outside the script is at least four hundred years old, which means it must be a old manuscript before Wilfrid M. Voynich obtains it.
