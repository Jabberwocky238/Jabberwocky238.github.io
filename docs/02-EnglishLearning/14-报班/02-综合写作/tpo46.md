The reading passage and the lecturer have a discussion on advantages of the electronic medical record system. 
The reading mentioned three potential advantages of the electronic medical record system. 
On the contrary, the lecturer consider none of them would be effective ==with certainty==.

The speaker simpley disagrees that this system ==would help to== decrease the costs of the medical records ==since== there would be fewer records in form of paper by pointing out the fact that ==there would still be huge amounts of paper records.== 
==With the electronic records,== doctors would still need to keep the paper records ==as emergence==, and base on certain regulations and laws, doctors would have to save the paper records. Therefore, they would need to pay for the using and storage costs for the paper records just as before.

The lecturer ==diputes== the idea of preventing errors with the general situations where doctors have started to use electronic records systems. 
==WIth this system,== those doctors would still prefer to take notes on the paper when they are checking the conditions of their patients. 
After the meeting that is between doctors and patients, there would be a staff from the hospital to input all the materials to the computer. 
Then those staff would have to face those problems from the handwriting, which doesn\'t change the situation at all. Therefore, even though with the electronic records, the issue related to the handwriting couldn\'t be elimitated.

The lecturer dismisses the benefit of aiding research by illustrating the private rigts of patients and the process of the research. If researchers would need to collect information form the electronic system, they would need to follow some strict and time-consuming steps since those materials are totally private to patients and researchers would have to ask for permission based on the private law. Also, there is no gurantee that they would obtin the information they need in the end since it depends on the will of the patients. Therefore, this system won\'t benefit the researchers regarding collocting information.
