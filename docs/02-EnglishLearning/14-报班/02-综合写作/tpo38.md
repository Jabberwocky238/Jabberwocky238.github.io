In the passage, three possible solutions of protecting the forests from P. amorim are discussed. 
However,none of them seems plausible according to the listening material.

allege = argue = proclaim = contend

First, the article ==argues== that preventing P. amorim spores from spreading could be an effective way, considering that human-assisted spread can be controlled easily by simple actions such as letting hikers to wash their shoes. 
==On the contrary==, the lecture ==emphasizes== the difficulty of this method because a large amount of spread is made possible by rainfall and water streams. 
In this way, it gets much harder to control the spread.  

In addition, the article ==proclaims== certain fungicidal chemicals can contribute to protection of oak trees by reducing the possibility of being infected. 
==However==, the lecture ==challenges== this point ==by mentioning that== fungicidal chemicals are effective only when they are directly injected to the oak trees at an interval of several months. 
==Since== there are thousands of oak trees in the forest, it will be a waste of both time and money to do so.

Lastly, the passage ==contends== that clear-cutting could be an efficient way to stop the spread of infections by cutting and burning both the diseased oaks and the seemly healthy surrounding vegetation. 
==By contrast==, the lecture ==indicates== the limitation of this solution ==by pointing out that== there are many rare vegetation species which cannot grow back easily in the forest. 
==Thus== the damage ==this method brings about== actually ==outweighs== that ==the spread itself does==.



The reading material shows three different methods to solve the infection problem caused by a microscopic fungus called Phytophthora ramorum. However, the professor opposes each of them in the lecture.

First, the passage argues that stopping spores from human-assisted spread, such as spread by way of shoes and bicycle tires, can be an effective method. By contrast, the professor claims that researchers have found the human activities have no huge impacts on the spread. Instead, the rainfall will pick up more spores and wash all of them into the stream, which is more severe than human-assisted spread.

Second, the passage proclaims that a few fungicidal chemicals can be used to protect the trees through stimulating the oak trees' natural defenses. On the contrary, the professor contends that this kind of chemical only works after injecting directly into tree trunks, and their effect lasts only for a few months, so the injections have to be repeated. Besides, Injecting for the entire forest is not only impractical but also expensive.

According to the passage, the third approach is called clear-cutting, which means cutting and burning the diseased oaks and the seemingly healthly vegetation surrounding the oaks. However, the professor is not in agreement with the reading passage. To elaborate, the vegetation in many forests of the western United States includes tree species that are very rare and cannot grow back easily. So this method will cause much ecological and environmental damage than expected.

Thus ==the damage this method brings about== actually outweighs that the spread itself does.
