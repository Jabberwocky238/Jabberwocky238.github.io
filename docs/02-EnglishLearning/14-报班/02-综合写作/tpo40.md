The lecture disagrees with the opinion of the reading passage , which stated that creating a permanent human presence on Venus is impossible . 
==Acknowledging the fact that== it is difficult to build a station , the lecture stated that it is still definitely possible to create a station on Venus and pointed out a possible solution to those challenges . That is , to create the station that floats at fifty kilometers above the surface of the Venus .

At the outset = 首先

According to the lecture , the air pressure far from the surface of the planet is going to be much lighter than the pressure on the surface . 
Moreover , the pressure at the height of 50 kilometers above the surface of the planet will be just like the standard air pressure on Earth , so it is definitely possible to have structures that don ' t need to worry about being crushed by the atmosphere . 
==This claim is not in agreement with that of reading passage== , which said that all the spacecrafts trying to cross the atmosphere is going to be smashed by the extreme environment of pressure .

==The second point of difference between the lecture and the reading passage concerns== the supply of water and oxygen , which are keys to the survival of human on Venus . The lecture asserts that the chemical reactions between the natural reactants in Venus ' atmosphere can be used to produce abundant water and oxygen , which means it ' s absolutely unnecessary to delivery those resources from Earth .

==Finally , the lecture argues that== human can build solar panels to collect solar energy from the clouds beneath the station . 
However , the reading passage argues that the light from Sun in the upper layer of the atmosphere is at very low level , that cannot support the basic needs for living .
