The explanations for the extinction of massive spices in the end of Triassic period is the focus of the writer and the professor. 
Three explanations , including the decline of sea levels , massive climate cooling and an asteroid strike , have been elaborated . 
The Professor , however , claims that all such assumptions are incorrect .

As opposed to the writer ' s first argument that ==sea levels were fluctuating== , which contributes to the decrease of the animals live in the shallow ocean and affects on food chain worldwide , the professor gives the theory that it does not make sense . 
To explain further , she ==advances that== animals who live in the shallow water are able to adapt to the change of sea levels .

The professor ==continues to discredit the writer ' assertion that== the activities of volcanoes released the sulfur dioxide , which lows the temperature , leads to the massive climate cooling and animals ' extinction , by saying that the sulfur dioxide cannot live long in the earth . 
To be more specific , she advances that the surf dioxide can be cleaned out by the atmosphere as well as it can mix with water to become rain .

==It is the professor ' s third argument that== the asteroid strike cannot account for the extinction of species , which contradicts the view of the professor that the strike of asteroid makes species die and starve by blocking the sunlight for several weeks or months . 
To explain deeper , she says that the crater made by the strike of asteroid was proved to happen long before the extinction , which makes no differences on spices .

The reading material proposes three possible explanations for the extinctions taking place in the Triassic period, while the lecture casts doubt on all these explanations with the following arguments.

==At the outset==, the reading passage makes a point that a potential decline of sea levels could destroy shallow-ocean species, and disrupt the whole food chain. However, the professor in the lecture ==challenges this point by the fact that== the fluctuating of sea levels during that period was very slow, which means animals could have enough time to adapt to the gradual decline of sea levels.

Moreover, ==the reading passage alleges that== sulfur dioxide might lead to massive climate cooling and in turn the extinctions. ==Nevertheless==, the professor argues the sulfur dioxide emitted by volcanos couldn't stay for a long time in the atmosphere and would quickly fall back to the ground. As a result, the sulfur dioxide wouldn't lead to a long-term global cooling needed by the massive extinctions.

Finally, ==the reading passage raises another reason that== an asteroid strike could make plenty of debris in the atmosphere, which would block out sunlight and in turn kill plants. ==In response==, the professor contends there is no evidence showing an asteroid strike happened at that time as no crater dating to the extinctions have been found. As a matter of fact, the crater closest to that period dates to 12 millions before the extinctions.
