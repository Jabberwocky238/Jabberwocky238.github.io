听音乐的好处（放松，缓解心情，消磨时间）

首先，音乐是放松自己的好工具。
比如说，我们这些学生的日程安排都很紧。
尤其是在最后几个季节，我们经常感到疲惫，不得不夜以继日地学习。
通过听音乐，我们的头脑会得到更新，我们的压力也会得到释放。
之后，当我们再次回来学习时，我们会感到精力充沛。
除此之外，音乐还有助于改变一个人的坏心情。
例如，如果我在过去的考试中因为成绩不好而感到不舒服，音乐可以成为治愈我心碎的有效药物。
在听了一些平静而慢节奏的音乐后，我所有的坏情绪都会烟消云散，我可以恢复到良好的状态。
更重要的是，音乐可以作为一种有效的消磨时间的方式。
假设你在公共汽车上经历了一段漫长的旅程，感到非常无聊和疲惫。
听一些音乐，你会发现自己沉迷于一个美妙的世界，时间会很快流逝。


First, music is a good tool to relax ourselves. 

Say, we students all lead a tight schedule. 

Especially during final seasons, we often feel exhausted and have to study around the clock. 

By listening to music, our minds get refreshing and our presssure gets released. 

After that we will feel energetic when we come back to study again.

Apart from that, music can help to change one's bad moods. 

For example, if I feel ==under the weather== because of the bad grade in the past exam, music can be an effective medicine to heal my broken heart. 

After listening to some peaceful and slow-paced music, all my bad moods would vanish into thin air and I can come back to a good condition again.

What's more, music can serve as an effective way to kill the time. 

Say you are suffering a long journey on the bus and feel it really boring and tiring. 

By listening to some music, you will find youself get indulged into a wonderful world and the time would pass away/fly quickly.

网络的好处

网上购物要便宜得多，比如说我需要在书店花一百元买一本书，但我只需要在网上商店花大约60元买同一本书。所以它要便宜得多，省下的钱可以花在其他有意义的事情上。

It is much cheaper to go shopping online, Say I need to pay one-hundred for a book in the bookstore, but I only need to spend about 60 for the same book on the online shop. So it is much cheaper and the money saved can be spent on other meaningful things.

地点素材——楼下的reastaurant

It has a variety kinds of food like Chinese food, Italian food, Indian food and so on so you have many choices in the restaurant. All the food it serves are really delicious that you will surly want to go there a second time once you eat in that restaurant.

The environment in the restaurant is fantastic. Say, there are soft sofa with large seats, big and bright windows beautiful decorated walls. Also, while you are eating, the restaurant would play soft music. All those would help you enjoy a wonderful meal in the reastaurant.

The restaurant has a good location. It is just opposite to my school and it would only take about 5-min to get there from school. So it would be a convenient place for me to go and have lunch there. I can usually have a short break in the restaurant after the meal.
