<p>It's very easy to take credit for the thinking.</p>
<p>The doing is more concrete, but it's very easy for somebody to say, &quot;oh, I thought of this three years ago&quot;.</p>
<p>But usually when you dig a little deeper, you find that the people that really did it were also the people that really worked through the hard intellectual problems as well.</p>
<p>My entire life has been spent only in one industry, which is this one.</p>
<p>But I've been in it now for about 15 years, and I've seen a lot of people fail a lot of things.</p>
<p>And my observation is that the doers are the major thinkers.</p>
<p>The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker-doer in one person.</p>
<p>Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint, or the technology he would use to paint it? Of course not.</p>
<p>Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist, knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy.</p>
<p>And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result.</p>
<p>And there is no difference in our industry. The people that really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers.</p>
