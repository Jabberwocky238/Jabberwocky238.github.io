<p>I don't know about you guys, but every <span class="origin-text">once in a while<span class="translated-text">偶尔，有时</span></span>, I'll just have a day where my brain is actually working well.</p>
<p>The gears of my mind are fully <span class="origin-text">lubricated<span class="translated-text">润滑了的</span></span>, fully <span class="origin-text">torqued<span class="translated-text">扭矩</span></span>.</p>
<p>When I'm in a conversation with somebody, I don't have to search for the right words to say.</p>
<p>They kind of just bubble up to the surface and I can <span class="origin-text">sling them out of my mouth<span class="translated-text">从我嘴里蹦出来</span></span> onto them.</p>
<p>Or if I'm reading a book, I'm actually able to comprehend what I'm reading. I'm actually absorbing the material.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm at a party and I'm just a little bit more confident.</p>
<p>I have a bit more <span class="origin-text">swagger<span class="translated-text">大摇大摆，神气十足地走</span></span> in my step and I'm way more social than I usually am.</p>
<p>If you've had a similar experience, you probably also know that these moments are <span class="origin-text">fewer and further<span class="translated-text">越来越少</span></span> in between than we would probably like.</p>
<p>It almost seems like once in a while, the universe decides to <span class="origin-text">zap<span class="translated-text">毁坏，打击</span></span> us with this extra level of mental <span class="origin-text">clarity<span class="translated-text">清晰，清楚</span></span>.</p>
<p>It's like a glimpse of our potential. It's a glimpse of how social or how confident or how clear-headed we could be if we did the right things.</p>
<p>And it was actually this very feeling that got me into self-improvement way back when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>And I was kind of frustrated that I didn't feel like this all the time. I wanted to <span class="origin-text">get to the bottom of it<span class="translated-text">弄清真相</span></span>.</p>
<p>How can I more consistently feel like, there's not this brain fog? How do I operate at my full potential more often?</p>
<p>Well, I'm happy to report that I haven't figured it out.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend like I know the answer to living at your full potential every single day of the week.</p>
<p>Because I don't think that's actually possible.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of a <span class="origin-text">fallacy<span class="translated-text">谬论</span></span> of perfection.</p>
<p>But I want to <span class="origin-text">go over<span class="translated-text">仔细检查，认真思考</span></span> three things that have really helped me clear mental fog.</p>
<p>And it helps me operate closer to my mental potential than if I didn't do those things.</p>
<p>I just want to say that if you haven't seen my video on how to stop being tired all the time, I think that is a necessary precursor to this video.</p>
<p>Because if you are doing things wrong in your sleep, diet and exercise, which are kind of your fundamentals to feeling well, then I don't think doing these additional tips will necessarily help you.</p>
<p>But if you do feel like you have a pretty good <span class="origin-text">grasp<span class="translated-text">理解，领悟，控制</span></span> on your sleep, diet and exercise and you're still feeling mentally <span class="origin-text">sluggish<span class="translated-text">迟缓的</span></span> and brain foggy and your life's a mess, then maybe these tips will help you.</p>
<p>So strategy number one is to practice something I like to call graduated stimulation.</p>
<p>From my experience, a great deal of my lack of mental clarity is stimulation induced.</p>
<p>When I do something that's overly stimulating, like browsing social media for hours and hours, or I get into a YouTube rabbit hole, just <span class="origin-text">binging<span class="translated-text">狂欢作乐</span></span> videos all day long, I sort of start to develop a brain fog.</p>
<p>It might be a result of kind of turning your rational brain off for a while and just indulging in this <span class="origin-text">primal<span class="translated-text">原始的</span></span> existence where you're just injecting yourself with <span class="origin-text">dopamine<span class="translated-text">多巴胺</span></span> and stimulation like you're a <span class="origin-text">fiend<span class="translated-text">恶魔，狂</span></span>.</p>
<p>And this is a problem because I feel like a lot of us have a habit of doing our internet rounds first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>We check Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, we kind of just see what's new in the world.</p>
<p>It's sort of giving ourselves hits of stimulation before we've even done anything.</p>
<p>Before we've even fed ourselves, before we've cleaned ourselves up.</p>
<p>This makes it extremely difficult to hop into something more boring, more slow paced, like doing whatever your job is, writing an essay.</p>
<p>So a way to solve this problem is to practice graduated stimulation, to organize your day in a way that sort of <span class="origin-text">ramps up<span class="translated-text">上升，增加</span></span> the stimulation as the day goes on.</p>
<p>So say whatever the most important thing you have to do in the day is like one out of 10 entertaining.</p>
<p>It's not very fun. You're kind of <span class="origin-text">dreading<span class="translated-text">畏惧，厌恶</span></span> it.</p>
<p>You should do that thing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When you first wake up, when you have that mental energy before your brain is absolutely <span class="origin-text">corroded<span class="translated-text">腐蚀，侵蚀</span></span>, you should dive into that 1 out of 10 not very fun thing first.</p>
<p>And then you can move on to things that are gradually more entertaining as the day goes on and as your willpower seems to sort of drain and your physical energy levels start to drain, etc.</p>
<p>So with this method, you're not really cutting out these internet rounds that everyone seems to do.</p>
<p>You don't have to stop really checking your social media, but you should <span class="origin-text">postpone<span class="translated-text">推迟，延期</span></span> that until after you've done the most important things that you have to do on your to-do list.</p>
<p>That way it doesn't seem like there's such a huge entertainment <span class="origin-text">disparity<span class="translated-text">差距</span></span> between your <span class="origin-text">habitual<span class="translated-text">惯常的</span></span> pleasures and the things that you actually have to do.</p>
<p>If you start from zero, then doing the not so fun thing is actually more fun than doing nothing a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Whereas if you're <span class="origin-text">binging<span class="translated-text">大吃大喝，狂欢作乐</span></span> social media, which is like 7 out of 10 fun, and then you try to do the less stimulating boring thing, it seems like you're <span class="origin-text">missing out<span class="translated-text">错过了</span></span>. It's like &quot;oh, this is dreadful.&quot;</p>
<p>Strategy number two is brain dumping.</p>
<p>One of the craziest things about the human mind is that a bare minimum of 90% of all of our brain activity is subconscious.</p>
<p>And I say a bare minimum because there's a little bit of argument in the scientific <span class="origin-text">realm<span class="translated-text">领域，范围</span></span> about this.</p>
<p>Some scientists say that this number is as high as 99.9% of all of our mental function happens at the subconscious level, which means that as we <span class="origin-text">go about<span class="translated-text">做，从事，进行</span></span> our day, everything that we're intaking, inputting, everything that we're smelling, we're seeing, we're hearing is being processed behind the scenes, even though we may not be consciously aware of it.</p>
<p>This is extremely important when it comes to mental clarity, because we really need to monitor what our subconscious knows, because even though we might not be paying attention to it, we still know about it and it still affects us and it leaks into every single thing that we do.</p>
<p>A great example of this is if you have a business meeting or something you're supposed to remember, maybe an <span class="origin-text">errand<span class="translated-text">差事，差使</span></span> or taxes you're supposed to fill out.</p>
<p>The more things that you have piling up that you need to do, even if you're not paying attention to it, the stress of these things is going to affect every aspect of your being.</p>
<p>By putting things off, by postponing things, by procrastinating things, we're pretty much <span class="origin-text">delegating<span class="translated-text">委托</span></span> it to our subconscious to worry about.</p>
<p>And if we delegate too many things to our subconscious to worry about, it can often start to become way too much.</p>
<p>And it starts to, we start to become anxious and stressed and overloaded and brain foggy.</p>
<p>So I think a great way to deal with this problem and make sure that you greatly reduce the risk of this happening is by getting in the habit of doing something that I like to call a brain dump.</p>
<p>Every single possible little thing, everything you have to do, everything you're responsible for, everything that you need to remember, you write down.</p>
<p>You have a giant document where you just <span class="origin-text">let loose<span class="translated-text">不加拘束，放开</span></span>.</p>
<p>And it may seem <span class="origin-text">counterproductive<span class="translated-text">适得其反</span></span> to have a giant mountainous list of things that you have to do.</p>
<p>You might feel like you will get overwhelmed with this.</p>
<p>In my experience, it's a lot less stressful to have this giant list than to have that list in your head leaking into every single thing that you do throughout the day.</p>
<p>It's way better to have a physical copy of your anxieties than it is to keep it in your head and try to be as <span class="origin-text">thorough<span class="translated-text">彻底的，充分的，全面的</span></span> as possible. Just doing that will help you ease the burden off of your subconscious.</p>
<p>You're kind of just emptying your mind onto a piece of paper.</p>
<p>You're just clearing it of all the <span class="origin-text">filth<span class="translated-text">污秽</span></span> and just putting it somewhere that's outside of you.</p>
<p>Now, as constructive and relieving as that will <span class="origin-text">inevitably<span class="translated-text">不可避免的</span></span> be, I would highly recommend taking it a step further and then organizing your tasks according to the <span class="origin-text">Eisenhower complex<span class="translated-text">艾森豪威尔法则</span></span>.</p>
<p>Now, the Eisenhower complex is basically just a system for organizing the importance and urgency of your various tasks.</p>
<p>Things that are both important and urgent, you should do first.</p>
<p>Things that are urgent and not so important, you should find a way to delegate or do kind of a little bit later or at the end of the day, when you don't need as much mental energy.</p>
<p>Things that are not urgent, aka not time sensitive, but are still important. You should find a way to plan for those things and figure out a time where you can slowly chip away at it.</p>
<p>And things that are not urgent and not important, you just shouldn't do. Anything that's on your brain dump that is neither urgent nor important, you should find a way to just rid yourself of the responsibility of doing that thing.</p>
<p>I cannot express to you how much mental clarity this will give you.</p>
<p>Just not having your subconscious overloaded with all of these tasks and responsibilities that you have to do.</p>
<p>And instead have them present on some sort of external organized template will free up your brain to work properly.</p>
<p>Now, the third thing I want to <span class="origin-text">touch on<span class="translated-text">谈及，涉及</span></span> is something that's kind of <span class="origin-text">beaten like a dead horse<span class="translated-text">死马当活马医</span></span> in the self improvement community.</p>
<p>But I have a few things to say about it and that is mindfulness.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is basically the act of training your brain to exist not in the hypothetical, but in the real.</p>
<p>You kind of bring your consciousness from outside of your head and all the busy, anxious, noisy thoughts that's going on in there inevitably.</p>
<p>And you bring it into your body, into what's in front of you, what's <span class="origin-text">tangible<span class="translated-text">有形的，可感知的</span></span>, the sights and the smells and the feelings all around you.</p>
<p>It really stops you from overthinking everything.</p>
<p>And as we've kind of <span class="origin-text">gone over<span class="translated-text">克服</span></span> this overthinking or <span class="origin-text">hyper-cerebralization<span class="translated-text">过度用脑</span></span> is kind of the main driver of brain fog.</p>
<p>And one really interesting thing about mindfulness is that although it is best practice to do it every single day, you don't really have to.</p>
<p>Once you start learning the mechanics of exiting your hyper-cerebralization and entering the present moment, you start to view the world through a different lens, a more objective lens, one that kind of accepts reality as it is.</p>
<p>And this can change your viewpoint permanently.</p>
<p>If you find that you're someone who overthinks everything, you're <span class="origin-text">prone to<span class="translated-text">容易，易于</span></span> anxiety, you're prone to overthinking, mindfulness is kind of a <span class="origin-text">no brainer<span class="translated-text">无脑，不用动脑子</span></span>.</p>
<p>So for like two weeks, just practice mindfulness for five minutes a day.</p>
<p>There's a million tutorials on YouTube <span class="origin-text">as to<span class="translated-text">谈到，关于</span></span> how to do that, but I think it's kind of a no brainer.</p>
<p>So to <span class="origin-text">recap<span class="translated-text">概括，简要回顾</span></span>, practice graduated stimulation.</p>
<p>Figure out what the most important things that you need to do in the day are and do those things first.</p>
<p>Postpone your social media binge as long as possible and gradually ramp up the entertainment value of each activity that you have to do as the day goes on.</p>
<p>Secondly, practice brain dumping. Take everything that's overloading your subconscious and put it onto a physical medium, a giant word document of every single thing that you have to do and then organize that brain dump into the Eisenhower complex.</p>
<p>Thirdly, practice mindfulness. Learn how to exit the noise of your head, learn how to stop hyper-cerebralizing everything and enter the present moment where things are a lot more clear, simple and calm.</p>
<p>If you do these three things, I would be shocked if they didn't work for you.</p>
<p>Because these three things were some of the most important things in giving me mental clarity on a more consistent basis.</p>
