##### 我是学生，没时间

As a student
I usually have a very tight schedule
in which case i have no time for my entertainment

generally speaking, 
i have to dedicate a significant portion of my time in the library,
preparing for my exams or papers, going over the lessons
in order to get a higher score in the final exam

#### 倾向于安静的地方，图书馆，夜间
it’s quiet in the library / in the evening,
i can focus on the things 
which are more worth dealing with
like reading books, writing papers, preparing for exams and stuff like that. 
And I am able to finish all my tasks very quickly. 

when there are no people around me
==i can immerse myself into meditation==
==which allows my mind to relax completely==

But if i meet others there and work on group projects, 
it will be quite noisy, people are moving around, dampening their interest toward learning ==to varying degrees==
so students who study there will get distracted and will not be able to concentrate.

#### 孩子的养成
###### 体育
kids who play team sports can actually have better social skills
this kind of sports, like basketball or football, actually ==involve a lot of interaction and communication==
when playing football, kids have to work together to ==come up with different strategies== to win the game
and also they have to ==practice making long or short pass to each other==
Therefore, in the whole process,
they may communicate with each other a lot which can actually ==improve their social skills==
###### 品格
Developing Children’s Financial Management Skills 经济管理能力

Improving Budgetary Control Abilities 提高预算控制力

==nurtures== the cultivation of self-control 自控力

foster Self-reliance and self-improvement characters 培养自立自强性格

expand their outlook

cultivate their autonomy and sense of duty 自主性和责任感

which is conducive to their long-term growth and the formation of good personality

###### 结尾句
==Struggle itself towards head is enough to fulfill mans heart.==

==all of the effort and sweat are negligible in comparison to the life-long lessons.==
doing experiments themselves could actually ==benefit children==
it is important to practice it rather than just talking.

instead of vice versa
==it is not the XXXX but the habits we developed that matters.==

#### 朋友好
for most people, it is no doubt that a few close friends outweigh a bunch of common friends.
when you get into troubles, close friends can save you in a timely manner
when you cannot get out of bankruptcy, close friends can rescue you in an emergency
when you too anxious and nervous to sleep, close friends can share their naive outlooks of life.
all the things i have mentioned above cannot be done by those stranger friends


#### 网购方便，省时间
what I mean by that is

people could just stay at home, choose the commodities they wanna buy
and then pay for them directly on the Internet.
And after all of that, they can just wait for the package at home. 

But if they go shopping in a big mall or shopping center, 
they have to drive one hour or two to get to the nearest spot 
and spend the whole day there, shopping around from one store to another, 

in some cases, they even encounter with the severe traffic jam.

==which will be a significant waste of time== 

After all, it could be an easy task if we choose ==shopping online==.

#### 老师
they know how to captivate students’ attention
in class, they might arrange some class activities 
encourage us to engage in discussions and exchange ideas with the professor

like class discussions or presentations where students could exchange ideas with others 
which can help them ==gain== a better understanding of the lecture topics. 

But new teachers’ classes ==might be a little bit boring== 
because they just graduated 
and thereby they might do all the talking in class on their own
which will make students get bored and ==even fall asleep==.
which definitely will hurt my study efficiency

###### phrase
captivate our attention
encourage us to engage in discussions
exchange ideas with the professor
participate more in class activities

might be a little bit boring
get boring and distracted
hurt my study efficiency


#### 环保

one way to reduce air pollution is planting trees 
because trees are able to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through a process known as photosynthesis 
and thereby the air will become much cleaner.

But if not, there will be more and more co2 pouring into the atmosphere 
which will create more severe pollution. 

So people might have to wear special masks to protect themselves 
and some people might get sick like getting lung cancer or ==respiratory system disease==. 
Even worse, some people might even die because of this. 

people can choose to take public transportation like subway or bus 
because in this way, the amount of private cars running on the roads will be reduced 
and thereby there will be less carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen monoxide in the atmosphere. 
Eventually, the air quality will improve and people will lead healthier lives.
