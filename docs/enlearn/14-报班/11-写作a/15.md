Both Paul and Claire have presented valid opinions on retaining existing employees. In my view, increasing salaries is a more effective strategy for companies to retain their workforce.

It is widely recognized that salary is a crucial factor influencing job choices. 

When employees receive higher salaries, they experience an improvement in their overall ==financial well-being==, which extends to their ability to afford various expenses such as clothing, electronic devices, and even vehicles. 

This financial stability also ==enhances their overall happiness and job satisfaction==, making them more ==inclined to== stay with their current employer. 
 
In conclusion, I firmly believe that ==elevating salary levels== is the most effective approach for companies to retain their employees,
