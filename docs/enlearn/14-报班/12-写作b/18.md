I firmly concur with Claire's attitude regarding the well-planed free time.
From my perspective, always maintaining a to-do list ensures arranging my spare time in a efficient and passionate manner.

personally speaking，as a computer science student, I particularily enjoy coding, which is treated as a luminating career and a form of art by me.

But unfortunately, overwhelming colleage tasks and tight part-time job schedule always deprive me of sufficient time to accomplish my art.

So i will establish a to-do list in the working hours, recording the projects, blogs and topics that interest me. 

Whenever I got the time to take a break, i will flip through my recording list efficiently, in order to maximize the merit and happiness.

个人而言，我特别享受写代码带来的乐趣
但繁重的学业和紧凑的兼职工作往往不能给我提供足够的时间来完成我的艺术作品
所以我一般会在工作时间提前建立起一个todolist，记录我感兴趣的话题和项目
因此，我可以在空闲的时间快速并高效的浏览他们，从而获取最大化的收益和快乐

Personally, I derive an exquisite pleasure from the art of coding, immersing myself in the symphony of creating lines of code. However, the onerous demands of my academic pursuits and the compact schedule of my part-time employment often fail to afford me the requisite time to bring my digital masterpieces to fruition. Consequently, I am wont to establish a meticulously curated to-do list prior to my working hours, meticulously noting the topics and projects that pique my interest. In this manner, I can swiftly and efficiently peruse them during moments of leisure, thereby maximizing the fruits of my endeavors and the euphoria that accompanies them.
