Both Kelly and Paul shares their percious viewpoints regarding the best method to make new friends. 
In my opinion, joining in the same team to paticipate in certain competiions is the fastest way to attain solid relationships.

We students majored in STEM usually have tremendous championship competitions to take part in. Take me for example, as a computer science student, the least member amount to join in a math model competition is 2.
So I have to gather 2 more student who have as the same passion for this game as me. In order to achieve a higher score and win in this brutal competition, we need to commit a significant portion of time. During this hiatus, a unbreakable and bulletproof friendship will emerge.
