I totally concur with Claire's viewpoint regarding the unnecessity of mandatory measurement on students' soft skills.
From my perspective, quantifiablity is of vital importance in education, and soft skills the professor mentioned above are undoubtedly can not be monitored in quantity.

即使学校的首要职责是培育孩子善良的人品和教给孩子社会生存技能，也不能说明把软实力的度量加入进去是合理的。
Though the primary responsibility of schools includes fostering students’ ==virtuous== characters and teaching students the basic living skills in society, it is not rational to take the measurement of “soft skills” into account.

像同情心，工作热情等软实力，本就是性格的一部分。
When it comes to the so-called soft skills, such as empathy and work ethic, we cannot deny the fact that these are inherent components of personality.

而性格的塑造往往是大量独特的经历和童年的生长环境的交叉作用结果。
Furthermore, the formation and refinement of personality are always the result of the interaction between tremendous personal experiences and living environment in childhood.

学生只需要在课堂学到学术知识即可，课堂不应该浪费时间在提升学生软实力上面。
Hence, classroom time should not be wasted on developing the soft skills. Instead, the only need for students is to dedicate the majority of time and gain enough academic knowledge.

Even though the primary mission of a school is to cultivate the virtuous character of children and ==impart them with the skills== necessary for societal survival, it does not justify the inclusion of metrics for soft skills as a reasonable measure.

Soft powers such as empathy and work enthusiasm are inherently part of one's character.

The formation of character is often the result of a complex ==interplay== between a multitude of ==unique== experiences and the ==nurturing environment of one's childhood==.

It is ==sufficient== for students to acquire academic knowledge within the confines of the classroom; the classroom should not ==be trivialized with== the pursuit of enhancing students' soft skills.
