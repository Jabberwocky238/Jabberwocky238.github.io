And as we all know,
as the progress of global education development
somehow there is a kind of inflation of the education degrees or exam scores
So nowadays,
you have to study harder than not only Yesterday yourself but everybody else 
in order to get a limited rescource, a job or stuff like that

from my perspective I prefer to choose the former one as my own home.
because as a matter of fact, I already live in this situation
and Ironically speaking, I'm benefited from this because I have learnt how to concentrate and focus in the very noisy place
so there is no doubt for me to choose a noisy place as my own home. 

What's more, there are so many amenities like restaurants, shopping centers and public transportation nearby, it is so convenient for me.
