题目

We've been discussing ways that parents can helpprepare their teenage children for adulthood. Oneline of thinking is that parents should encouragetheir teenagers to take part-time jobs to help themlearn to be responsible, even if it is not aneconomic necessity for the teenagers to work.What are your thoughts on the issue? Shouldparents urge teenage children to get a job? Why orwhy not?

Claire

Teenagers should work part-time. When l was 16, l washeddishes at a restaurant, and i'm glad l did. l learned a lot abouttime management.l had to use my free time wisely to makesure l could complete homework despite spending timeworking at a job. This is a valuable life skill.

Andrew

would have to disagree. A teenager is still just a kid, and inmy opinion, a kid needs to focus on going to school andlearning. A job would be an unnecessary distraction. lf it's allabout learning responsibility, l think there are a lot of otherways to do that without the commitment required by a job.

我的答案

I firmly concur with Claire's viewpoint on the valuable time management skill learned from part-time job.
From my perspective, 
getting a part-time job not only boardens the horizon but also promote the development of independent personality.

It is widely acknowledged that the real society is far away from what have been taught in school and what we see on the internet.
By engaging in a part-time job, children can have a close contact with reality, develop important life skills and establish a correct recognition of society.

Additionally, part-time job provides a platform to train financial management skills and contact with strangers, 
which promote the development of self-independence and responsibility.

Ironically, the slightly unessesary distraction derived from part-time job is negligible compared with the substantial real life lessons.
