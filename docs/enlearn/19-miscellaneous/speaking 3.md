**Some people like having a wide variety of friends and acquaintances they can spend time with. Others like to spend most of their free time with the same small group of close friends. Which do you prefer? Explain why.**

I tend to prefer having a small group of close friends that I spend most of my free time with. I find that having deep, meaningful relationships with a few people is more rewarding than having casual acquaintanceships with many people. There are a few reasons why I prefer close friendships over casual ones. First, you can really get to know someone on a deeper level when you spend a lot of time together. You understand their personality, values, interests etc. Second, close friends are the ones that you can truly rely on during difficult times. They provide emotional support and are always there for you when you need them. Casual acquaintances may not have that same level of commitment.

Finally, long-term close friendships lead to fond memories over time. You accumulate lots of meaningful shared experiences that strengthen the friendship bond. Of course, it’s nice to have casual acquaintances too for fun social interactions. But for me, the meaningful, supportive relationships I share with my closest friends are most important. They add so much joy and richness to my life. I’m willing to put in the time and effort to nurture those special bonds. In the end, quality means more to me than quantity when it comes to friendships.

**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?**

**Eighteen-year-olds are not mature enough to vote.**

**Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.**

**同意的版本**

  

I agree that 18-year-olds are generally not mature enough to vote responsibly. There are a few reasons why I take this position.

First, the brain is not fully developed until the mid-20s. The prefrontal cortex, which handles decision-making and impulse control, is still forming at age 18. This affects judgement and ability to make well-reasoned choices, like evaluating candidates and issues.

Second, 18-year-olds typically lack life experience and wisdom. Most are just graduating high school and still figuring out adulthood. They are heavily influenced by peers and have not yet developed their own views. Their opinions are often idealistic rather than realistic.

Third, voter turnout data shows that those 18-21 vote at much lower rates than older adults. This indicates a lack of civic engagement and sense of responsibility. Voting seems to be more of a novelty than a duty at this young age.

While some exceptional 18-year-olds may be ready to vote, most are still developing the maturity needed. With more life experience and greater wisdom, they will become responsible voters. The voting age should stay at 18, but our expectations for civic maturity should not be too high for this age group.

  

not mature enough to vote - 不够成熟,不够投票

legally begins adulthood - 法律上开始成年

perform the responsibility of voting - 执行投票的责任

make informed voting decisions - 做出明智的投票决定

research candidates and issues - 调查候选人和议题

lowering the voting age - 降低投票年龄

leads to more involvement - 导致更多参与

lack life experience and wisdom - 缺乏生活经验和智慧

heavily influenced by peers - 易受同龄人影响

idealistic rather than realistic - 理想化而非现实化

lack civic engagement - 缺乏公民参与

developing the maturity needed - 正在发展所需的成熟度

become responsible voters - 成为负责任的选民

**反对的版本**

I disagree with the statement that 18-year-olds are not mature enough to vote. I believe 18 is an appropriate age to allow people to vote, for several reasons.

First, 18 is the age when adulthood legally begins in most countries. At 18, citizens can join the military, get married, and sign legal contracts. If society considers 18 the start of adulthood, they should be allowed to perform the citizen responsibility of voting.

Second, many 18-year-olds are mature enough to make informed voting decisions. Of course some are immature, but the same could be said for people of any age. With a proper high school education, 18-year-olds understand government and can research candidates and issues before voting. Their choices should be respected.

Finally, voting helps young people engage with society and politics. Lowering the voting age encourages positive civic participation at an earlier age. This leads to more involvement in social issues and government later in life.

In conclusion, 18-year-olds have the maturity and knowledge to make voting decisions. Their adulthood and education prepare them to be responsible voters. Voting rights are appropriate for this age group and help create engaged citizens.

**State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement. Then explain your reasons, using specific details in your explanation.**

**People are more likely to enjoy themselves at concerts or films if they go with a group of friends.**

  

I agree that people are more likely to enjoy themselves at concerts or films if they go with a group of friends. There are a few key reasons for this.

First, going with friends makes the experience more social and fun. You can discuss the concert or movie together before and after. During the event, you can share reactions and enjoy the experience together. Being with friends enhances the overall experience.

Second, being in a group gives you more confidence to participate. For example, at a concert you may be more likely to sing along, dance, or cheer when surrounded by your friends. Their energy and enthusiasm can bring out the same in you.

Finally, when you go with friends, you ensure you will have someone to talk to. If you go to an event alone, you may feel awkward or bored without having friends to chat with. With a group, you'll have built-in company.

In summary, sharing experiences like concerts and movies with friends makes them more engaging, energetic, and entertaining. The social nature of going with a group leads to increased enjoyment of the event itself.

第二版本

  

I disagree with the idea that people are more likely to enjoy concerts or films when attending with a group of friends. While going with friends can be fun, it is not a requirement for having an enjoyable time. There are a few reasons why going alone can be just as pleasurable.

First, watching a film is often an immersive, solitary experience, even in a crowded theater. Being absorbed in the story and images on screen does not require interaction with other people. The same is true for becoming lost in the music and performance during a concert. These are individual aesthetic experiences.

Second, attending events alone allows you to fully focus on the entertainment itself. You can pay attention to every song at a concert without distractions from friends. Watching a movie alone lets you fully grasp the plot and characters without disruptions from others.

Finally, going solo means you don't have to compromise on what to see or do. You can choose the events and seating you want without having to accommodate the preferences of friends with different tastes.

In conclusion, while sharing experiences with friends can be fun, it is not a prerequisite for enjoying concerts and films. Immersing yourself in the performance or story and following your own preferences also leads to great enjoyment. Going solo can be just as pleasurable as going in a group.
