I completely align with AAA's belief that

### example
In my opinion, performance grading is what college students truly need since it provides them with a stronger motivation to learn.

Pratical experience will greatly promote / hinder students' academic developments as they can deepen their understanding in their field of study.

The overuse of technology will have a positive / negative impact on our ==personal development== since it will promote / hinder our independent thinking.

We shall definitely ==prioritize== economic development ==over== enviromental production due to the fact that a stable economy ==is the very foundation of== social, scientific, and industrial development.

I belive gap year will greatly promote students' academic development as ==students can deepen their understanding== in their future field of study.

In my view, a gap year offers students ==more benefits than drawbacks==. ==The extended period of rest== allows for a deeper understanding of their major, which I believe greatly ==enhances their academic development.==

==It is certain that== ongoing job training is an essentail part of business because it helps employees to stay competitive in today's rapidly changing world.

I completely ==align with Jake's opinion== that grades are ==the most effective way== to measure students' comprehensive abilities and ==the effort they invest in their academic work.==

In other words,

instead of A, B....

### example

To be more specific, during a discussion, students not only have to come up with their own thoughts but also consider those from others, which stimulate an active way of thinking.

To elaborate, ==practical experience during the gap year== will help students witness the true nature of a job instead of developing ==impractical imagination based on their limited experience==, building a  real passion in their future pursuit.

To be more specific, ==instead of relying on outdated skillsets==, ongoing job training not only privides empolyees an insight into advanced strategies but also equip them with competitive techinal skills, which ==*in turn* helps the campany to keep vibrant.==

helmets are ==typically== effective in the event of a severe crash

### example

For example, students can find diiferent ways of thinking for whatever questions they have with thieir mobile phones wherever they are, ==greatly boardening their mind.==

For example, ==by using my iPad to attend classes,== I have replaced the traditional stack of notebooks with a single device that offers ==a far more convenient method== for recording and reviewing my coursework. This switch has not only streamlined my study process but also enhanced my efficiency significantly. The portability and accessibility of the iPad enable me to ==engage with educational content anytime and anywhere==, fostering a more interactive and dynamic learning experience. This has undoubtedly been a substantial enhancement to my college education.

For instace, last week ,my little niece had a homework from her biology class about animal behaviors. Instead of relying on limited knowledge on books, she used her mobile phone to search for diverse information on internet, including why and how animal play, which ==earned her a good grade== for excellent work.

Nevertheless, ==some might claim that== students learn something beneficial to their life through their hard effort ==regardless of== the performance. However, we all need to learn from out mistakes and correct them in time, instead of persisting on wrong ideas or approaches.

Still, ==a voice arises that== the cost of attending college rises each year, and we need to start college life as soon as possible. Ironically, such cost is ==nothing compared with== the life-long regret of studying a wrong major.

> such cost is nothing compared with the life-long regret of studying a wrong major.
#### substantiation
*Nevertheless, some might claim that students could lose their communication skills and they ought to study with those around them.* However, devices such as smart phones actually bring students closer with communication applications, while with proper guidance devices such as computers can significantly promote the efficiency of group work.

#### elaboration
*Nevertheless, some might claim that students could lose their communication skills and they ==ought to== study with those around them.* However, electronic devices are simply tools that are not different from textbooks or lab apparatus, and it is we the users that determine their purposes, in other words, even without electronic devices, people who are not willing to work with others wil still find other ways to stay away.

*Still, a voice arises that businesses can save money from training by recruiting new empolyees*. Ironically, even the most talented and skilled new employees will need time and training to ==best adapt== themsevlves to a new enviroment, which is a lot of times more expensive than ongoing job training. ==In addition==, what is even worse is that new hires might make mistakes and potentially cause significant business losses.

Nevertheless, some argue that investing in additional training may be **prohibitively** expensive, and that the funds could instead *be allocated to* attract ==more qualified candidates==. Nonetheless, frequent turnover among staff can be **detrimental** to ==both the cultivation of the company’s culture and its reputation== in the long run.
