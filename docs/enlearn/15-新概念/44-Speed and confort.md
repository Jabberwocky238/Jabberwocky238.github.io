<p>People traveling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land, sea or air. Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>长途旅行的人经常不得不决定他们更喜欢陆上、海上还是空中旅行。几乎没有人能真正享受在火车上坐上几个小时以上的乐趣。</p>
<p>Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy. It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey. Reading is only a partial solution for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep.</p>
<p>火车车厢很快就会变得拥挤和闷热。几乎不可能把你的注意力从旅途中移开。阅读只是解决车轮在铁轨上咔嗒作响的单调节奏的部分方法，很快就会让你入睡。</p>
<p>During the day sleep comes in snatches. At night when you really wish to go to sleep you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling or fumbling to find your ticket for inspection. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even less pleasant for it is quite impossible even to read.</p>
<p>白天睡眠是断断续续的。晚上，当你真的想睡觉的时候，你很少能做到。如果你足够幸运地找到了一个卧铺，你会花半个晚上的时间盯着天花板上的小蓝灯，或者摸索着找你的票来检查。不可避免地，你到达目的地时几乎筋疲力尽。长途汽车旅行就更不愉快了，因为它甚至连阅读都不可能。</p>
<p>On motorways you can at least travel fairly safely at high speeds but more often than not the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic. By comparison ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts.</p>
<p>在高速公路上，你至少可以在高速下相当安全地行驶，但通常情况下，大部分行程都在服务站很少、交通流量过大的道路上度过。相比之下，渡船旅行或游轮提供了各种各样的文明舒适。</p>
<p>You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food. Always assuming of course that the sea is calm. If it is not and you are likely to get seasick no form of transport could be worse.</p>
<p>你可以在宽敞的甲板上伸展双腿，玩游戏，结识有趣的人，享受美食。当然，总是假设大海是平静的。如果不是这样，而且你很可能会晕船，那么任何形式的交通工具都不会更糟。</p>
<p>Even if you travel in ideal weather sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of traveling by sea.</p>
<p>即使你在理想天气下旅行，海上旅行也需要很长时间。相对而言，很少有人愿意牺牲假期时间来享受海上旅行的乐趣。</p>
<p>Aeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travelers are intimidated by them. They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport. But nothing can match them for speed and comfort.</p>
<p>飞机以危险著称，即使是久经考验的旅行者也会被它们吓倒。它们还有一个缺点，那就是运输方式昂贵。但在速度和舒适度方面，没有什么能比得上它们。</p>
<p>Traveling at a height of 30,000 feet far above the clouds and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience. You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly. For a few hours you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight.</p>
<p>在30000英尺的高空以每小时500英里的速度旅行是一种令人振奋的体验。你不必想办法把你的注意力从旅途中移开，因为飞机会让你迅速到达目的地。几个小时后，你坐在一把深扶手椅上享受飞行。</p>
<p>The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available there is plenty to keep you occupied. An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world.</p>
<p>真正的逃避现实者可以在一些服务上看电影、喝香槟。但是，即使没有这样的改进，也有很多东西可以让你忙碌起来。一架飞机为你提供了一个不同寻常的、令人叹为观止的世界观。</p>
<p>You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. And you really see the shape of the land. If the landscape is hidden from view you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud planes that stretch out for miles before you while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky.</p>
<p>你毫不费力地飞越高山和深谷。你真的看到了土地的形状。如果景观被隐藏起来，你可以欣赏到绵延数英里的不间断云层的非凡景象，而阳光在晴朗的天空中灿烂地照耀着你。</p>
<p>The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time one thing is certain. You will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled. You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey.</p>
<p>旅途如此顺利，没有什么能阻止你读书或睡觉。无论你决定花时间，有一件事是肯定的。你到达目的地时会精神抖擞。在接下来的几天里，你将不必从漫长而艰苦的旅程中恢复过来。</p>
