I firmly concur with Kelly’s statement about the right that business has to keep the discovery secret. In my opinion, science discovery is totally rely on financial support and can not be shared inherently.

It is a widely recognized fact that each science discovery usually burns out a huge amount of money, in which case certain goals cannot be achieved without financial support. Therefore, we can interpret the outcome of discoveries as a kind of assets, which definitely cannot be shared among scientists. Ironically, commercial competition is so crucial, thereby no problem for governments and businesses should consider for any no profit sharing.

I wholeheartedly agree with Kelly’s stance on a business's right to maintain the confidentiality of a scientific discovery. 

In my view, scientific breakthroughs are entirely dependent on financial backing and are not inherently meant for public disclosure.

It is an acknowledged reality that significant scientific discoveries often ==entail== substantial financial expenditure.

Without such monetary ==investment==, certain objectives would remain unattainable. 

Consequently, the results of these discoveries can be likened to assets, which are not to be freely distributed among the scientific community. 

Ironically, ==in the face of fierce commercial rivalry,== it is deemed acceptable by governments and corporations to ==forgo== any notion of profit-sharing ==in the interest of competitive advantage==.
