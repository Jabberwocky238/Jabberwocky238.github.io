I wholeheartedly concur with Andrew’s viewpoint concerning significant benefits that close friends could bring about. In my opinion, opting for close friends can not only get access to worthwhile information quickly but also relax during the discussion hiatus.

There is no denying that information plays a pivotal role in this digital era. While the quality of information and the efficiency to acquire it determine one’s overall competitiveness, close friends who constitutes a solid and unbreakable union can share the private and secret information in a timely manner, thereby guaranteeing that each member could attain the information of wide range and maintain a high level of individual competitiveness. Moreover, close friends chat without hiding, in which case we do not need dedicate a great amount of energy in order to adjust our language in mind just for sake of expressing in a proper manner.
