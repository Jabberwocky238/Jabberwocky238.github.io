其他人给的意见不一定有效，会浪费时间
快往往更好，决策的效率越高，往往更有生产力

well in my opinion I think the first one would make a better leader because as we all know in the commercial competition the faster you can be the more prolific you are so acting quickly is a very significant character for team leader and second Lee in the most time mothers will not give you any effective solution to your problem because they don't know what context it is for example very start very and why it should be like that how to construct all of them together and everything that will waste your time so just don't bother them and make decision on your own so I prefer to think the first will be the better team leader

学生忙，理解对方

age as me i can chat with them talk with them ....t friends of different ages cannot do

Well in my opinion well in my opinion I prefer to have friends who are the same age as me because has a busy student I usually have a very tight schedule I'm no time attainment because I need to go over my notebook prepare for exams and search information online for papers and stuff like that so if I can have a friend who has the same age as me I can share with them talk to them and share experience to each other and as we all know the teenagers are the same age can understand each other better and that is what friends of different ages cannot do

pocket money零花钱

well in my opinion I agree the statement that Children should be rewarded for their effort even if they are not successful. Take financial management for example you can lead them to manage their pocket money or wallet and in this process develop a good ability to control the budget and money N they will have a very good ability in their young age for financial management and there will be very good for their long term development and future career. Even if this project is not successful they still can learn something in this process. Which means it is educational and useful and lessons they learned will be conducive to the entire span of their life

Yes I agreed statement that Children who participate in the organized system sports are better social Li develop and Children who do not, because in this process they can develop a good social skill let's take football for example they need to work together to come up with different strategies to win the game and in this process they will practice making long or short pass to each other and training together which involves a lot of interaction and Communication I'm in this whole process they will talk to each other a lot and communicate with each other And I will be conducive to their social skill and beneficial for the future career and social life.

Yes I totally agree with the statement that is more difficult to save money today than in was in the past let's take me for example, I am a student and I can not afford my school tuition only depend on my part time job, but my Mother even came a for this and gain the extra for her daily life
however, the global economy is changing so fast
the inflation rate is going up year after year, so there is a fact you cannot deny that you cannot afford the same thing even in the next year so is definitely harder today to save money than when our grandparents were young

Well in my opinion I would accept the job that begins in the morning and finishes in the afternoon, 
personally,  I study more efficiently in the evening than in the  morning, because I can concentrate and focus on my goals in a quiet environment, but I can not do that in the morning, At that time I would be very anxious and restless, I prefer to study at night because I can calm down, focus on my exams or papers, go over my notebook and lessons without any interruption.
What's more I can touch the reality at daytime, i mean everybody is working at that time. And I can experience a lot in this process
which will be beneficial for my future career and social skill.

不，学生都累，不利于学习，乐趣有助于人格成长
no I disagree with the statement that Children should be required to help with House of tasks ** **** as they are only no 
because when they are old enough they are not only Children but also students, they need to go to the school or college
and majority of them even have no time for entertainment, so there is no spare time for them to do some household tasks, in the most time we students usually spend time in the library, preparing for exams and papers, going over the lessons and notebooks in order to get a higher score in the final exam, if the Children can have their spare time,  just let them to relax, which will be beneficial for their development of confidence and self esteem and conducive to their study in the long term

From my perspective I prefer to read electronic format on the computer or other device 
take me for example When I am walking on the street, boring and tedious
I will not carry a text book in my pocket, which will be too heavy for me, 
I prefer to carry my mobile phone and whenever I want to see some books, I can just take it out, open a certain software, search its name online and I can find that book and start to read, It is very convenient for me to read any books anywhere
