Claire's assertion that governments should promote the construction of large buildings with affordable apartments in cities is indeed valid. 

From my perspective, the ==presence== of cost-effective apartments in urban areas not only ==facilitates== easier ==commutes== for residents but also serves as an effective solution to the housing challenges faced by ==densely populated== countries. 

It is a well-acknowledged fact that housing problems have become ==major concerns== for countries with high population densities and limited land resources, such as South Korea and Japan. 

By erecting affordable ==high-rise buildings and apartment complexes==, a larger portion of the population can access housing with manageable mortgage payments. 

This approach offers a ==straightforward solution== to the complex housing issue. 

In contrast, if governments attempt to address the problem by constructing individual urban houses, they may encounter constraints due to limited available land.

Therefore, ==promoting affordable apartment buildings in cities emerges as a more practical and inclusive approach to alleviating housing challenges.==
