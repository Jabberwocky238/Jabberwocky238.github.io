I find Andrew's point about experienced senior teachers evaluating other teachers to be valid. 

However, I hold the perspective that student feedback offers a more comprehensive means of assessing teachers. 

This is because students are the individuals who have the most ==direct and thorough== understanding of their teachers. 

Students attend every class, receive feedback on assignments, and seek assistance from their teachers when needed. 

Through these interactions, students gain insights into their teachers' teaching abilities, patience, and fairness. 

Moreover, students observe their teachers over an extended period, which ensures that their evaluations are less prone to one-sided opinions. 

==Hence==, I firmly believe that teachers should be evaluated by students as they possess a unique perspective and ==are deeply acquainted== with their teachers' performance in the classroom.
