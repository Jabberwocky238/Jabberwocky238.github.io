The reading passage focuses on the topic of the origin of bees. 
While the reading claims that bees does not exist 200 million years ago, the lecturer asserts that the arguments in the reading are not convincing and bees do have such a long history. 
And in the lecture, he uses three specific points to ==bolster== his viewpoint.

First, despite the fact that no fossils of bees have been discovered, 
the lecturer contends that the bees existed 200 million years ago, 
but at that time they failed to be preserved due to a lack of tree ==resins==, which became common later. 
Obviously, the lecturer's argument disproves its counterpart in the reading.

Moreover, the lecturer asserts that early bees might be fed up with non-flowering plants. 
After the flowering plants appeared after millions of years, bees developed the ability to survive on flowers. 
The lecturer contends the relationship between flowering plants and bees is not simultaneous, 
which refutes the reading's claim that absence of flowering plants equals no bees.

Finally, the lecturer asserts that although the fossil structure lacks spiral cap, 
the chemical composition of the waterproof materials detected in the fossil is the same as modern bees, 
which directly rebuts the reading's claim.

The reading passage gives three arguments why the old fossil structure is not an actual bee nest. However, the professor refutes each of them in the lecture.

First, the passage argues that no fossils of bees have been discovered. By contrast, the professor contends that the bees existed 200 million years ago. To elaborate, fossils of bees failed to be preserved due to a lack of tree resins, which are pretty rare then and become common later.

Second, despite the statement in reading that the absence of flowering plants is skeptical, the professor states that the bees existing 200 million years ago are fed up with non-flowering plants rather than flowering plants. After evolving, the bees have developed the ability to survive on flowers.

Third, even though the passage alleges that the fossilized structures lack spiral cap, the professor challenges this point by mentioning that the modern study have detected the new chemical evidence of waterproofing substances, which is the same as modern bees. Thus, the structures are definitely built by bees instead of other insects.
