Well, I think libraries should be a quiet place because it is good for students’ study. 

I mean if it’s quiet in the library, students could focus on the things that they are dealing with like ==reading books, writing papers==, ==preparing for exams== and stuff like that. And they are able to finish them all very quickly. 

But if students meet others there and work on group projects, it will be ==quite noisy== and so ==students who study there will get distracted and will not be able to concentrate==

Well, I agree with the statement that kids who play team sports can actually ==have better social skills.== 

That’s because I think these kinds of sports like basketball or football actually ==involve a lot of interaction== and communication. 

So for example, when playing football, kids have to work together to come up with different strategies to win the game. 

And also, they have to practice making long or short pass to each other and stuff like that.
