Well I think it's a good idea for students to take a year off before entering college. That's because it can help them take a break. 

You know students are very busy in high school. They have to spend at least 10 hours a day at school attending classes, dealing with homework and stuff and so they are pretty stressed out. 

Therefore, if they could take a year off, they could travel a lot where they are able to enjoy beautiful scenery, taste delicious food and stuff which will help them get relaxed. And they can focus better on their schoolwork after entering college. 

They have to spend *at least 10 hours a day at school* 
attending classes, dealing with homework and stuff and so they are pretty stressed out.

## Student
spend 10 hours a day attending classes, dealing with homework and stuff, so they are pretty stressed out. 

==spend extra time== taking classes, going over their notes, reading textbooks
which will give them more evitable pressure, 
make them have less time to ==study obligatory courses==, hurt their grades even their graduation

enjoy beautiful scenery, taste delicious food and stuff 
which will help them get relaxed, renew their energy, refresh the mind, channel emotion properly

I think it is better for people to make it a priority to exercise
enjoy scenery, breathe fresh air, have a good stretch
which will help them ==renew their energy,== keep healthy, build a good figure, 
focus better on their schoolwork

## Empolyee
send emails, talk with clients on the phone, do interviews, deal with paperwork, make arrangements for meetings, stuggle for promotion

focus better on their work afterwards

## Teacher
grade homework assignments, do academic research, prepare for their classes

## Parents
parents today are becoming more and more busy
They have less time to 
accompany and communicate with their children, handle their problems, keep a good relationship

## Drop by 4 surprise
cannot meet my friend in person and disappoint him 
rearrange my schedule to meet him
have fun together like watch movies, have dinner, taste delicious food

## Proform well to univiersity
if well:
pass the exam, finish the homework and graduate on time

## E device
when the breaktime comes, we can
watch some videos, listen to musics, text my friends which will help relax ourselves
