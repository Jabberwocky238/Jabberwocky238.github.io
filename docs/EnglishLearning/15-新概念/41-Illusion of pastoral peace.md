<p>The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me. City-born and city-bred, I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasionally visit during the weekend.</p>
<p>乡村宁静的生活从来没有吸引过我。出生在城市，成长在城市，我一直把乡村视为你从火车窗口看到的东西，或者你周末偶尔会去的东西。</p>
<p>Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of them has ever gone to live in the country, and he was back in town within six months. Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life.</p>
<p>我的大多数朋友都住在城里，但一提到这个国家，他们总是欣喜若狂。尽管他们赞美平静生活的美德，但他们中只有一个人去过乡下生活，不到六个月就回到了城里。甚至他仍然生活在一种幻觉中，认为乡村生活在某种程度上优于城镇生活。</p>
<p>He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature, and the gentle pace of living. Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockroach. The twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture.</p>
<p>他永远在谈论友好的人民、干净的空气、与自然的亲近和温和的生活节奏。他坚持认为，没有什么能与第一只蟑螂相比。黎明时鸟儿的叽叽喳喳声，初升的太阳在树上和牧场上闪闪发光的景象。田园诗般的田园风光只是画面的一部分。</p>
<p>My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV, virtually the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work.</p>
<p>我的朋友没有提到电视前漫长而没有朋友的冬夜，这几乎是唯一的娱乐形式。他没有提及商店里糟糕的商品选择，也没有提及那些每天不得不从乡下到城市去上班的不幸的人。</p>
<p>Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They could be safe so much misery and expense if they choose to live in a city where they rightly belong.</p>
<p>我无法理解为什么人们为了在这个国家生活的可疑特权而准备忍受每天四个小时的旅行。如果他们选择生活在一个他们理应属于的城市，他们可以安全地度过如此多的痛苦和费用。</p>
<p>If you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They invariably live nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evenings entertainment.</p>
<p>如果你能摆脱乡村为数不多的田园乐趣，你会发现这座城市可以为你提供生活所能提供的最好的东西。你不必长途跋涉去见你的朋友。他们总是住在附近，随时可以非正式聊天或晚上娱乐。</p>
<p>Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them, this is a major operation which involves considerable planning. As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home.</p>
<p>我在乡下的一些熟人每年都会来城里一两次，作为一种特殊的享受参观剧院。对他们来说，这是一项需要大量规划的重大行动。随着比赛接近尾声，他们想知道是否能赶上回家的最后一班火车。</p>
<p>The city-dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest exhibitions, films or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping too is always a pleasure. There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best.</p>
<p>城市居民从来没有经历过这种焦虑。最新的展览、电影或戏剧离这里只有很短的巴士车程。购物也总是一种乐趣。有太多的多样性，你永远不必将就着第二好。</p>
<p>Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry. Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold, wet winter nights.</p>
<p>乡下人在城市购物时会狂奔，拖着尽可能多的异国物品蹒跚回家。这座城市也不乏美丽的时刻。在寒冷潮湿的冬夜，广告散发出的温暖光芒让人感到安慰。</p>
<p>Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends, when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me why city dwellers who appreciate all these things obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.</p>
<p>没有什么比周末冷清的城市街道上的宁静更令人印象深刻的了，当时每天上班的数千人都躲在乡下的家里。为什么欣赏这些东西的城市居民固执地假装他们更喜欢住在乡下，这对我来说一直是个谜。</p>
