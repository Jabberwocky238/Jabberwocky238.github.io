<p>It has never been explained why university students seem to enjoy practical jokes more than anyone else. Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke, the hoax.</p>
<p>人们从来没有解释过为什么大学生似乎比任何人都更喜欢恶作剧。学生们专门研究一种特殊类型的恶作剧。</p>
<p>Inviting the fire brigade to put out a non-existent fire is a crude form of deception which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in. Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims.</p>
<p>人们从来没有解释过为什么大学生似乎比任何人都更喜欢恶作剧。学生们专门研究一种特殊类型的恶作剧。邀请消防队扑灭一场根本不存在的火灾是一种粗暴的欺骗形式，任何自尊的学生都不会沉迷其中。</p>
<p>When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university, he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill. As soon as he had hung up, he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away, they were not to take him seriously.</p>
<p>最近，当一名学生看到两名工人在大学外使用风钻时，他立即打电话给警察，告诉他们两名学生打扮成工人正在用风钻破坏道路。他一挂断电话，就走到工人面前，告诉他们如果警察命令他们离开，他们就不要把他当回事。</p>
<p>He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of city jokes on people. Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information.</p>
<p>他补充说，一名学生装扮成警察，对人们开各种城市玩笑。警察和工人们都对这名学生事先提供的信息表示感谢。</p>
<p>The student hid in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on. Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away. When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen, he threatened to remove them by force.</p>
<p>这名学生躲在附近的一个拱门里，在那里他可以看到和听到发生的一切。果然，一名警察赶到现场，礼貌地要求工人们离开。当他收到一个工人非常粗鲁的答复时，他威胁要强行把他们赶走。</p>
<p>The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help. Shortly afterwards, four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen. As the men refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill.</p>
<p>工人们叫他为所欲为，警察打电话求助。不久之后，又来了四名警察，向工人们提出抗议。由于这些人拒绝停止工作，警察试图夺取风钻。</p>
<p>The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper. He threatened to call the police. At this, the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest.</p>
<p>工人们奋力挣扎，其中一个发了脾气。他威胁要报警。对此，警方讽刺地指出，这几乎没有必要，因为这些人已经被捕。</p>
<p>Pretending to speak seriously, one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station. Her mission was granted and the policeman accompanied him to a pay phone. Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.</p>
<p>其中一名工人假装说得很认真，问他是否可以在被带到车站之前打个电话。她的任务完成了，警察陪他去了一个公用电话旁。只有当他看到这名男子实际上在给警察打电话时，他才意识到他们都是一场骗局的受害者。</p>
