<p>Pumas are large, cat-like animals, which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted 45 miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claim to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>美洲狮是大型猫科动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告称在伦敦以南45英里处发现了一只野生美洲狮时，他们并没有受到重视。然而，随着证据的积累，动物园的专家们觉得有必要进行调查，因为声称见过美洲狮的人所做的描述非常相似。</p>
<p>The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw a large cat only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.</p>
<p>搜寻美洲狮的行动始于一个小村庄，一位采摘黑莓的妇女看到一只大猫离她只有五码远。当她看到它时，它立即逃跑了，专家证实，除非它被逼到绝境，否则美洲狮不会攻击人类。</p>
<p>The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place 20 miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits.</p>
<p>搜索被证明是困难的，因为人们经常在早上的一个地方和晚上在20英里外的另一个地方观察到美洲狮。无论它走到哪里，都会留下一条死鹿和兔子等小动物的踪迹。</p>
<p>Poor prints were seen in a number of places, and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Poor people complained of cat-like noises at night, and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma. But where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape.</p>
<p>在许多地方看到了劣质的指纹，在灌木丛中发现了紧贴着的美洲狮皮毛。穷人抱怨晚上有猫一样的噪音，一位商人在钓鱼时看到美洲狮爬上了树。专家们现在完全相信这只动物是美洲狮。但它是从哪里来的？由于该国任何动物园都没有美洲狮失踪的报告，这只美洲狮一定是由一位私人收藏家拥有的，并以某种方式逃脱了。</p>
<p>The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.</p>
<p>狩猎持续了几个星期，但这只美洲狮没有被捕获。想到一种危险的野生动物仍在宁静的乡村逍遥法外，真是令人不安。</p>
