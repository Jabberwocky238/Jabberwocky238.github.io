<p>Usually, before I go shaking my tits for the press, I like to go see how the professionals do it.</p>
<p>Some might say the chief of police has no business in an institution like this, but in fact it's the quietest and safest place in town.</p>
<p>You won't run into any reporters, nobody gets into any fights, nobody drinks too much, nobody even raises their voice.</p>
<p>The place is owned by an elderly gentleman who knows how to keep things under control. That's why I never invite my friends here.</p>
<p>I wanted to make an exception for my 60th birthday, but most of my colleagues are young enough to be my sons, and they'd rather just hire prostitutes. Why stare at some boobs when you can take the whole package for yourself?</p>
<p>But there's none of that in our club, even looking too long is considered indecent. You can get an occasional glimpse, like by accident.</p>
<p>The rest of the time you just pretend that you're immersed in conversation, or just come by for a drink.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean these gentlemen wouldn't want their bald heads smothered in tits, it's just that nobody says it out loud.</p>
<p>My younger colleagues might call it hypocrisy, but I call it the good old fashioned manners.</p>
<p>Good manners and leave the rest unsaid.</p>
<p>She agrees to unbutton her blouse, and we agree not to pay too much attention.</p>
<p>The girls are on a quiet prowl too, they're looking for a way out of their cramped rooms, maybe make friends with some wealthy patron with a pacemaker and dentures.</p>
<p>Everybody wants something.</p>
<p>But we have to control ourselves, or we'll all turn into libertines and prostitutes.</p>
<p>Hell, if there weren't any rules I'd be belching and farting, jumping up on the table, arms held high, yelling, shake it baby!</p>
<p>No idea how I got so barbaric.</p>
