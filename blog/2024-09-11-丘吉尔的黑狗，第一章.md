# chapter 1

## EN (ME)
- A psychiatrist plans to study a person's personality, but he has never known how this man live before. That's really an obstacle for him.

- Due to the perfession, in the dimension of judging personality, psychiatrist is undoubtedly superior to others, saying that they know people deeper than common people, that's not overstatement.
- But speaking of that, if the target doctors study about has already died, then the deep observation can only be done in the consulting room,

- 精神科医生打算研究一个人的性格，而这个人他却素昧平生，那还真是在跟自己过不去。

- 由于职业的关系，在性格的品鉴上,精神科医生可说是得天独厚,说自己对人的了解比一般人来得深人而密切，那也绝不为过。

- 但话说回来，如果他要研究的人已经作古，那么,只有在诊察室中才能够进行的深人观察，他也就失去了机会，顶多只能像个历史家，不得不去依赖一些弄得到手的文字记录。

- 对精神科医生来说，在分析诊断的过程中，病人的反应以及病人对自己的了解逐渐增加所引起的变化，都可以用来印证看诊的推论是否站得住脚。

- 一般而言，医生解读病人的行为或性格，出错或过于早熟，是非常可能的事，但分析若能长期持续，在双方的互动中，错误将可逐渐减少，真相也将慢慢浮现。

- 少了这种反复评鉴的过程，对大人物的生平所做的研究，方向难免偏离，其结果正如许多所谓的精神分析传记，既不成好的传记，也不是好的精神分析。

- 弗洛伊德与布利特(Bullitt)之研究伍德罗·威尔逊(Woodrow Wilson)，结果一塌糊涂，就是典型的例子。


## EN (official)
- THE PSYCHIATRIST Who takes it upon himself to attempt a character study of an individual whom he has never met is engaged upon a project which is full of risk. 

- In the exercise of his profession, the psychiatrist has an unrivaled opportunity for the appraisal of character, and may justly claim that he knows more persons deeply and intimately than most of his fellows. 

- But, when considering someone who has died, he is deprived of those special insights which can only be attained in the consulting room, and is, like the historian, obliged to rely upon what written evidence happens to be available. 

- In the analytical treatment of a patient, the psychiatrist is able to check the validity of the hypotheses which he proffers by the patient's response, and by the changes which occur in the patient as a result of his increased comprehension of himself. 

- The psychiatrist mayoften be wrong or premature in his interpretation of hispatient's behavior and character, but, as the long process of analysis continues, errors will gradually be eliminated and the truth recognized by both parties in the analytical transaction. 

- Deprived of this constant appraisal and reappraisal, psychiatrists who attempt biographical studies of greatmen are apt to allow theory to outrun discretion: with the result that many so-called psycho-analytic biographies have been both bad biography and bad psychoanalysis. 

- The disastrous study of Woodrow Wilson by Freud and Bullitt is a case in polnt.
